Off the top, we'll tell you that the back half of this list may have been the toughest to lock down. You're splitting hairs with a lot of these guys based on how much talent is in the NBA right now.

                <p>The NBA is back, and to get ready for what should be a truly epic season, the Complex Sports team decided to get everyone in their feelings and rank the top 50 players in the league entering the 2019-20 season. Obviously, this wasn't an easy task, and everyone has their own opinions on the highly disputed matter. But after hours and hours of debate, this is where we landed. Off the top, we'll tell you that the back half of this list may have been the toughest to lock down. You're splitting hairs with a lot of these guys based on how much talent is in the NBA right now.</p>
                <p>So no, you probably won't agree, but that's what makes this fun. You could go a number of different ways with how you rank each guy, and there's so much talent in the NBA today that this is a nearly impossible task to dive into. We do want to note that Kevin Durant and John Wall were left off of this list because they're not expected to play this season. If they were to, they'd clearly be in the top 50 and, in KD's case, the top 5. On the other hand, we included Klay Thompson because, unlike KD and John Wall, he's expected to play this season. Also, no Zion Williamson this year because he's a rookie, but based on the early returns in preseason, he'll be very high next year.</p>
                <p>With all of that being said, get ready to argue, and check out the Complex Sports list of the top 50 players in the NBA.</p>

                    <div class="description">In a perfect world, KP would be much higher, but the young 7-footer has a lot to prove this year. After forcing his way out of New York (I don’t blame him, but still, he hasn’t accomplished shit to be demanding trades), he’s matched up with his longtime friend Luka Doncic. Both will be cornerstones on the Mavs for years to come, barring injury. With that being said, I expect Kristaps to be a borderline All-Star this season as he’s finally going to turn those flashes we used to see at the Garden into everyday play. Big men like him are the present and future of this league, and he’s the only one that has the ability to be elite on both sides of the floor like no one before. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

He's averaged 14 and 9 in back-to-back seasons and probably was sacrificing A LOT of those rebounds to Westbrook. I’m sure those numbers will go up this year. He’s an underrated passer out of the post and does a lot of the intangibles that go unnoticed, like the brutal screens he sets or his ability to box out. He's better than Clint Capela, who benefits a lot from the system he’s in. I saw Kenneth Faried leave Brooklyn, go to Houston, and drop 21 and 15 with ease, filling in for Capela. With a new squad in OKC that should be a better shooting team with more space, Adams should have a career year. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Myles Turner is an interesting guy on this list. He’s obviously a really good player and an ideal big man for today’s NBA, but I’m not sure the Pacers are the team for him to thrive on. They probably need to choose between Sabonis and Turner at some point, and a new team might be best for Turner, who is looking to build on his 13 and 7 averages from a season ago. In any case, while he is with the Pacers, I really like the thought of Turner and Malcolm Brogdon working together this season. That’s a dynamic duo and should really help elevate Turner’s game on both sides of the ball. We’re still waiting for a full breakout year from Turner, but this feels like it could be it. For the Pacers, or someone else. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">The Bucks are really, really going to need Eric Bledsoe to be the guy this season. Not only are expectations through the roof for this Milwaukee team, but with the loss of Malcolm Brogdon, Bledsoe is now the main man at point guard. The Bucks gave Bledsoe a $70 million contract extension last season and need him to play up to that level of invested money. Added shooting from the addition of Kyle Korver should help clear some space for Bledsoe’s aggressive driving game, but I’m sure the Bucks would prefer he get closer to 35 percent shooting from three than his 32 percent mark from last season. The Bucks are the favorite in the East, but they’ll need Bledsoe to show up in the big moments if they want to bring home some hardware this season. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">We might have to start calling Williams the Pharrell of the NBA since it looks like he's barely aged after 14 seasons and 23,018 minutes played. He's incredibly one-dimensional, but if you need a bucket you can rely on Lou. His sweet jumper and silky smooth moves have made him one of the best bench players ever since he and Jamal Crawford are the only three-time Sixth-Man of the Year Award winners in NBA history. All the evidence we need to justify Williams, at age 33, belonging in our top 50 is this: He averaged 20.0 points in 26.6 minutes per game last season finishing every close game on the floor with the Clippers. Things will definitely be a little different in LA this season, but the No. 45 pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, long ago immortalized by Drake, will be ripping nets late in games way longer than just about anybody ever expected. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

While Luka tailed off a bit from his hot start to the season, Young started out awfully but came on in the second half as the guy who we all thought he could become. With a year under his belt and more young talent around him, he WILL be an All-Star within the next two seasons, barring injuries. After the All-Star break, he averaged 25 points and 9 assists. He settled in and dominated. If he were more consistent throughout the season, he would’ve easily been Rookie of the Year over Doncic. The Hawks low-key have something cooking with Young, John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and the new draftees De’Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish. They’re going to be a fun group to watch. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">CP3 still plays the game at a pretty high level, but the reality is he’s 34 years old and on his third team in four seasons. He’s struggling to stay healthy (he hasn’t played more than 61 games since the 2016-17 season) and while he can still pick your pocket, his defensive metrics have taken a dive in recent years. He’s still the most competitive SOB you’ll ever meet (seriously, I’ve got stories I can tell) and he can get you buckets, whether it’s backing down a similarly small statured opponent and nailing a pretty fadeaway, pulling up from mid-range, or drilling a trey. But his two seasons in Houston saw him launch from three and the question is will that continue to be his preferred method of scoring in Oklahoma City or wherever else he ends up landing? The future Hall of Famer will forever distribute at a high level (his career average is 9.7 dimes a game). We say all the above not to shade the Point God, but to come to terms with reality that Paul’s entering the twilight of his career and we should enjoy one of the all time greats while we still can at a high level. He just ain’t quite what he used to be. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

He had a career year, notching 24-5-5. I’m excited to see him a healthy Wendell Carter and Coby White in addition to Lauri Markennen and Otto Porter. If he can be “the guy” on that squad and they remain healthy, Chicago might sneak their way into the playoffs with the bottom of the East in question right now. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">An All-Star for the first time last season, the center got himself a max deal out of Orlando this off-season and he earned it. Averaging 20.8 points, 12.0 boards, 3.8 assists, and 1.1 blocks per last year, Vucevic's finest campaign in his eight seasons helped get the Magic to the postseason for the first time since 2012. He definitely falls under the radar when it comes to naming the NBA’s most productive players, but his win shares are comparable to peak DeMarcus Cousins. If you have an affinity for advanced metrics more than you more than likely have a deeper appreciation for Vucevic's talents and production. I could rip off a bunch of other esoteric stats (like PER, Box Plus/Minus, etc.) in which Vucevic finished in the top 10 last season, but I’m not going to get flashy here since that isn’t Vucevic’s style. He’s about as low maintenance as it gets. Just know he’s one of the game’s best centers. The stats don’t lie. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

Not only did this make the Celtics weaker, but Horford's presence should really open things up for Philly. I love the pairing with Joel Embiid, which will find two bigs who can not only stretch the floor, but are menaces on the defensive side of the ball. Throw in Ben Simmons and you have a super big lineup that will be a terror on the court. And while Horford doesn’t attempt a ton of threes, his shooting will be a welcomed addition to a lineup that desperately needs an outside threat. The Sixers will be right there in the East all season. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

There will surely be numerous trade rumors surrounding Love this season, but any team that does pick up the five-time All-Star, will be adding one of the best stretch big men in the NBA. Love continues to shoot the three ball at a high clip and is coming into this season healthier than ever. Love continues to be underrated, which is a byproduct of playing with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, but there’s no doubt that if placed on a contender, K Love will help them get over the top. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

He’s going to be a problem in this league and it could happen as early as this season. The Kings think they’re ready to take that next step and become a playoff team. They’ll need Fox to take that step and become an All-Star point guard. I think he’ll very much be in the conversation for the 2020 All-Star Game in Chicago. Coming into the league, his shooting was an area he had to work on a lot, and last year he quietly shot 37 percent from deep. If he’s hitting from deep at that rate again this year, there’s pretty much no way you can guard him. He’s too fast, too athletic. Mix that in with shooting and his playmaking ability, and he’s going to be unfair. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

Flat out, both guys are very good at what they do and the reason why so many people are high on the Nuggets this season. The NBA is a guard’s league and Jamal is one of the best at his position, especially when you look at the fact that he’s not even 23-years-old yet. He has a big body, can score, distribute, and is a willing defender. He showed last year how dangerous he could be offensively by scoring 48 and 46, respectively and averaging 21.3 points in the playoffs. He’ll creep into the top 25 before the season is over. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel DIaz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Drummond’s arguably the best rebounder in the NBA, after leading the league in boards again this past season. He put up 17 and 16 per night. It’s hard to ignore those dominant numbers. His game is pretty basic and limited, but his production is still high—he was an All-Star last year on a playoff squad. He’s in a contract year, so you might see his best numbers this season. Is he worth a max deal next summer? I’m not entirely sure, but a team will probably take the risk. I think the biggest thing for him is how can he take that next step. Looking at what he’s already done, you have to mention that he has already improved his FT shooting through his career, which points to how hard he works to sharpen his game. Drummond is poised for a big season in Detroit. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">It feels like Conley’s been around forever (he was, after all, drafted in 2007). But maybe he’ll finally get his due as one of the better point guards in the league now that he’ll be playing for a contender in the Western Conference and has seemingly put behind him some of those nagging injuries that soured far too many of his seasons in Memphis. The crafty lefty now calls Utah home and he’s a massive offensive upgrade over Ricky Rubio since Conley is a better scorer and shooter than the bearded Spaniard. Conley wasn’t the only big acquisition for the Jazz this off-season, but he’s probably the one Jazz fans should be most excited about as he’ll provide much needed veteran leadership for a team on the verge of a deep run in the Western Conference playoffs. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Long Island’s own. Harris got his money this summer, and thank God he saved himself from going to the Knicks. I think we saw peak Harris in Los Angeles, when he was pretty much the go-to option. He was snubbed from the All-Star team and later was traded to Philly to complete their superteam. Now, as a third or even fourth option playing alongside Embiid, Simmons, and Horford, Harris will be taking more responsibility from outside with the departure of Jimmy Butler. “Who takes last shot?” is a question Philly still has to answer. This year it probably should be Embiid, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Tobias has the ball in hands for the last shot, with Simmons’ inability to shoot off the dribble and Embiid being doubled once he touches the rock in the crunch time. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">On paper, you can’t really justify trading Kawhi Leonard for DeMar DeRozan. But as we know now, the Spurs really had no choice and felt that the Raptors offer was best. Things obviously worked out well for Toronto, who won their first NBA championship behind Kawhi’s dominant play, but I also think people downplayed how good DeMar is in this swap. Is he a perfect player? No, not by any stretch. But any guy who can go out and give you 20 a game while not relying on the three in 2019 is pretty damn impressive. And yes, you would prefer your two-guard not shoot under 20 percent from deep, but DeMar still gets buckets despite not shooting it well from beyond the arc. It’s highly doubtful the Spurs are contenders with this DeMar and LaMarcus Aldridge core, but there’s no need to diminish DeRozan’s accomplishments. He’s very good and, at this point, probably underrated. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

He was named the Most Improved Player in the league after blowing up big time and helping Toronto win its first NBA title. Averaging 16.9 points, 6.9 boards, and 3.1 assists per game, Siakam saw massive jumps in his numbers across the board and finished 16th in win shares (an estimate of how many wins he contributed to his squad). Two notable names that finished behind him in that advanced metric? Kyrie Irving and Joel Embiid. Siakam has potential star written all over him—he certainly has All-NBA caliber talent—but it’ll be interesting to see how he handles being the man with Leonard in Los Angeles. It’s about to get really real for Siakam. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

He’s a seven-time All-Star, made five All-NBA teams, and finished in the top 10 of MVP voting three seasons. He kind of gets lost in the scrum when you talk about the better power forwards in the league, but who led the league in 2-point field goals last season? LaMarcus Aldrige. Who finished in the top 10 of field goals and offensive rebounds, made last season? LaMarcus Aldridge. And who finished in the top 15 of rebounds, blocks, and offensive win shares last season? LaMarcus Aldridge. If he can continue averaging roughly 20 and 8.5 boards per game for a few more seasons then Aldridge might start to get some serious Hall of Fame consideration. The only thing holding him back from the respect he deserves is a lack of postseason success. Which, let’s be honest, is glaring. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Are his stats empty because he plays on a bad team or is he really as good as he seems? I subscribe to the latter, folks. Booker is a scoring machine and will be a scoring machine on every team in this league. Crying about double-teams during pickup games aside, Book’s game is evolving as he averaged three more assists last year than he did the season prior. In fact, his assist averages have steadily climbed since he came into the league. This means that he’s diversifying his game and is not just a chucker. And let’s remember that he’s only 22 years old. He needs to force his way out of Phoenix ASAP because they make the Knicks look like a competent organization. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Doncic dominated headlines the first half of last season. I’m not as fond of Luka as the world is, but he’s going to put together a Hall of Fame career. 21-8-6 as a rookie is just ridiculous. Add on the fact that he was 19 years old, and it's scary. It’s probably too early to put him in your top 20 for the best players in the league after only one season, but he was really good, and I expect him to be better with Porzingis as his runningmate. His efficiency from the field and three could've been better, but he was really doing what he wanted offensively, because that whole Mavs season became a stage to celebrate Dirk Nowitzki’s final season. You don’t need much explanation for this guy. He’s legit. Next. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

He’s one of the best young talents in the NBA and only getting better. He can create his own shot and continues to shoot well from deep while playing in an offense that is meant to slow things down at all costs. The Jazz will have more pressure than ever on themselves this season, but Mitchell has shown that he’s not only clutch, but can deliver in big games. With the addition of Conley as his PG, Mitchell’s life will only get easier as he looks to take the step to All-Star level in 2020. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

But when healthy, he’s a dogged defender that fills up a stat sheet and has blossomed into an All-Star caliber player. We’re probably not going to see him for a few more months while he continues to rehab from the ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, but as long as the Indiana Hoosier product hasn’t lost a step he just might be the closest facsimile to Jimmy Butler in the league. And if Jimmy is worthy of being our No. 14 player, how are you going to argue that Oladipo, who earned All-NBA third team and All-NBA defensive first team honors in the 2017-18 season, isn’t on the verge of earning top 25 status? <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

His talents and numbers don’t jump off the page, therefore, most casual NBA observers would classify him as overrated. But Middleton, coming off his first All-Star appearance this past season, is definitively Giannis Antetokounmpo’s No. 2 in Milwaukee because he can do a little bit of everything very well—there’s just nothing particularly spectacular about his game. Middleton’s been a pretty reliable shooter his entire career and if he ever elevated his jumper a few smidgens he could legit flirt with a 40-50-90 season (he’s finished a few seasons shooting above 50 percent from the field, 88 percent from the line, and over 40 percent from beyond the arc, but has never put it all together in one campaign). His athleticism isn’t going to wow you, but he’s a better than advertised defender, finishing in the top 20 of defensive win shares last season. Scottie Pippen he’s definitely not, but he’s damn good running mate for Giannis. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Jrue Holiday is one of the most underrated players in the NBA. Straight up. He’s coming off one of his best seasons as a pro and continues to get better year after year. As a 20 ppg scorer last season, Holiday continues to thrive in New Orleans on both sides of the ball. With the additions of Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and more, Holiday’s playmaking will be showcased on an entirely new level this season. Yes, he played with Anthony Davis before, but you could argue that this is the most all around talent that has ever been around Holiday. And it’s important to mention that new GM David Griffin said this is Holiday’s team. He’s there to lead them. So yes, the Pelicans will likely go as far as Holiday takes them, but thinking about the defensive upside of this New Orleans team should have fans excited about this season and beyond. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">I will always say that CJ McCollum is an All-Star guard that will probably never play in an All-Star Game because he plays in the West. That’s just the nature of the league. When I talked to Chris Brickley, he told me that Kevin Durant said CJ is the toughest guard one on one in the NBA. Not James Harden, not Steph Curry, LeBron, Giannis… CJ McColllum. He’s lived in the shadow of Damian Lillard most of his career, but if you’re a true NBA fan, you should know how good CJ really is. Just watch his performance in Game 7 of the Western Conference quarterfinals against Denver. Dame had a memorable postseason with the game winner and all that, but folks will forget he was absent in that match-up with the team’s back against the wall, down 17 points on the road. It was CJ who led the comeback and got Portland to the Western Conference Finals. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">What do you want in your point guard? I get that Walker leaves a little (or a lot, depending on your predilections) to be desired from a floor general, but he has some of the best handles in the NBA, owns a vicious step-back, can hit dagger jumpers like it’s nothing, and qualifies as a closer in our book. Walker earned elite recognition last season as an All-NBA third teamer so careful with the shade—he’s rightfully in the top 25 of NBA players. Whether or not he deserves max money is a different argument so save it for our purposes here. We know he’s more of a scorer than a distributor since he only averages 5.5 assists per game for his career, but let’s also keep in mind the squads he’s played with down in Charlotte where he’s always been the man. With more players and athletes at his disposal in Boston, it’s probably reasonable to expect more dimes. But he’s always going to be a scorer, dating back to his days at UConn, meaning he’s good for at least 20 a night and you’re fine with him taking a big shot since he was just as clutch a scorer as Harden and better than Lou Williams and Kyrie Irving by official NBA stats standards last season. We all know Walker isn’t on the same level as the Currys, Hardens, Westbrooks, and Irvings. But he ain’t that far behind. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Green was one of the hardest players to figure out for this list. His impact and skill goes way beyond the box score. We all know that. Can a guy who averaged under 8 ppg last season really be a top 20 player in the NBA? Yes, yes he can. Green is the motor that pushes the Warriors and he remains one of the best facilitators in the NBA for a big man. The playmaking aspect of Green’s game is unreal and always seems to drive the Warriors engine. His energy is contagious and the Warriors rewarded him this summer with a contract extension that will pay him over $20 million a year. The money speaks for itself. Green is one of the most disruptive defenders in the league and his role should expand this season with Klay Thompson out and K.D. in Brooklyn. Love him or hate him, Draymond Green deserves props for turning himself into one of the most impactful players in the league. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

If you dropped Beal on a contender, he would thrive and I wouldn't be the only shouting from the mountaintop about his standing in the league. Beal has the complete offensive package, and is an ideal guard in the NBA right now. He can shoot, drive, create, and everything in-between. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

That side of the ball takes maximum effort and Gobert already has two Defensive Player of the Year awards under his belt, including last season when he didn’t make the All-Star squad. All these top 50 lists don’t seem to value defense—but we do. Once he starts stretching the floor a bit, the Jazz will be real contenders one day.

I would take any kind of jumper at this point and make sure that it’s with his right hand. What’s bugged, though, is that Ben doesn’t necessarily need a jumper to be elite. However, his non-jumper having ass will be the sole reason why the Sixers will never rep the East in the Finals. Hopefully Ben worked on his outside game this offseason, but if not, we can continue to marvel at the other aspects of his game. Because even without a J, Simmons can do it all and is a willing and capable defender which is pretty impressive. He can get to the basket at will, can run the offense, and can defend all five positions. I’m not sure if the league will be ready once he starts making shots outside of the paint. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

He has all the tools to be elite and blaming any of the Timberwolves struggles on the young big man would be a mistake. I think a lot of people forget just how young KAT is, but it’s crazy that he’s a center putting up 24 ppg and shooting 40 percent from deep. His versatility on offense makes him one of the most exciting players in the NBA, and I know what you’re saying: his defense is lacking. But he’s still so young that I think he can improve on that side of the ball.

He’s become a respectable outside shooter, a better distributor of the ball, averaged a career-high 24.5 per game last season, and—most impressively—he’s been named to an All-NBA team five(!!!) times, including three appearances on the second team. He was All-NBA third team last season and I bet you didn’t know he had that many All-NBA appearances—unless you’re a certified Blake stan. Yeah, four of those came during his Clippers days, but last season’s third team honors proved that Griffin’s still got considerable game at age 30. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

The opportunity in Miami gives Jimmy his own team and he’s already started his journey by showing up six hours early to workouts. Yeah, he’s crazy, but Jimmy is going to be Jimmy. You know what you’re going to get from Jimmy, and that’s not only a walking bucket, but one of the best on-ball defenders in the league. His scoring dipped under 20 PPG last season, but now with his own team, we’re about to see elite Jimmy return. In fact, he’s almost a perfect fit for the Heat, who have always done things their own way. On the court, I’m not sure if Butler has enough help to make a real run at it this season, but you know Jimmy will get his. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

A healthy Klay is without a doubt one of the better two-way players in the NBA and one of the best shooters ever. Seriously. He’s absolutely going to go down as one of the best in NBA history and I’ve even gone on the record saying Klay has the overall skill set and talent to be one of the top 25 players of ALL TIME. People might think that’s blasphemous, but who heats up quicker than Klay and then Ds up on the other end of the court at All-NBA levels? While at age 29 he seemingly should return to form after suffering a torn ACL in the NBA Finals, he’s got the kind of stroke that is going to scare the shit out of every opponent when he spots up from the wing from now until he’s in a wheelchair. Shade Klay at your own peril, but real ones respect how dynamic Thompson is and his value to the Warriors. Did you forget how clutch he was during the Finals? Or how durable he’s been throughout his career, playing through injuries until his knee finally bent the wrong way? He also deserves props for being a meme legend. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

Yes, he may not have been the leader that Boston wanted him to be, and yes, he was awful against the Bucks in the postseason. But he was painted as if he had a terrible season. Kyrie probably had the best season of his career. He was All-NBA second team last year, playing in a place he clearly didn’t want to be in. He had a career high in assists, which proves he's still trying to get better each and every year. Not long ago Kyrie was regarded as a guard who didn't pass. Those days are over. Let’s see what he can do in a place he chose himself, playing with closest friends in the NBA. The notion that Kyrie will drive a young Nets team into the ground seems a bit extreme. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">I think Russell Westbrook is a top 10 player in the NBA, but the last two options were difficult to place him over after their performances last season. You can say what you want about Westbrook, like calling him a “stat-padder” or “chucker,” but the fact that he has normalized averaging a triple-double in this league is insane. His efficiency was drastically lower, but the Thunder were better when he was on the court. He couldn’t hit a shot from deep, and that was a bit concerning, but a new system in Houston could open up his game a bit more. We’ll see how playing with another ball-dominant guy in James Harden works out, but one thing I can say is that Russell Westbrook hasn’t played on a team that can shoot as well as the Rockets. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

The boy put up 28 points, grabbed eight boards, and snatched two steals a game. But even those crazy numbers and Westbrook averaging a triple-double for the third straight year couldn’t get OKC out of the first round. Now with the Clippers, P.G. looks to play Pippen to Kawhi’s Jordan and they may very well be the best defensive pair since Scottie and Mike. George has turned himself into a perennial MVP/DPOY candidate. He can lead his team in scoring while locking down the opponent’s best player. That is rare. Playoff P hasn’t reached the Conference Finals since the Pacers went back-to-back in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Look for him to come back from surgery with a point to prove as the Clippers battle the Lakers for L.A. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

He is without a doubt the best passing big in the league and one of the best passers overall in the NBA. A lot of players are judged how they carry their regular season performance into the postseason, but he improved in the playoffs as he averaged 25-13-8 in 14 games. Simply put, Jokic shows up in the big moments. He can create for others and get buckets in a variety of ways. He’s also only 24 years old.

                    <div class="description">Joel Embiid is one of the most entertaining players to watch in the NBA. The fact that he’s been able to bounce back from some serious injuries and become a dominant force in the league is a true testament to his work ethic and natural skillset. Embiid is a joy to watch on both ends of the floor and continues to improve year in and year out. It’s almost stunning to watch what a guy his size is able to do in the paint and how he’s able to move almost like a guard. Embiid has improved his points per game average in each of his three years in the league, and has consistently been a finalist for Defensive Player of the Year. Not that it would be some sort of shock, but I think Embiid has a great chance to take home that honor this season. It’s going to be a special season in Philly. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Not having The Beard in our top five is going to get some fans in their feelings. But hear us out. Harden is the game’s most dynamic scorer, and if you believe his hyperbolic general manager, Daryl Morey, he’s better at it than Michael Jordan ever was. That’s the perfect barbershop debate we’re going to leave alone for now, but there’s no denying the 2017-18 NBA MVP is in a league of his own when it comes to getting buckets. Harden seems to add something new to his offensive arsenal every season (one-legged 3-pointers coming for the 2019-20 season?) and is probably the most devastating one-on-one player in the game currently. He gets demerits for his well-advertised defensive liabilities and postseason flameouts. But between his handles, his patented step-back three, and his propensity to get “NBA Jam” levels hot and score 50 like it’s nothing, Harden, only 30, has elevated himself to living legend status. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

                    <div class="description">This is the year everyone will understand and appreciate how good Anthony Davis truly is. After a tumultuous season and a disappointing seven years in New Orleans I feel like his skillset has been underappreciated. There won’t be any excuses anymore as he’s playing on the game’s biggest stage alongside it’s biggest superstar. AD will be on a mission to be named DPOY next season while also making the three a real part of his game. Gone are the days where he has to do it all with him and LeBron going back and forth on offense like Styles and Jada. I know it sounds crazy, but I expect Davis to turn in his best season as a pro in 2019-20. Are the Lakers better than the Clippers? I don’t think they are, but they sure have the talent to beat them in a seven-game series. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">It seems like folks forgot that Steph Curry was a back-to-back league MVP before Kevin Durant showed up. Let’s not act like his game has deteriorated in any way since those seasons. He’s still the guy that has changed the game of basketball. He’s still fresh off a season in which he averaged 27-5-5. He dropped 47 points in Game 3 without KD and Klay. I mean, the Raptors threw a box-and-one out in the Finals to slow him down. We’ll see how he fares with his sidekick Thompson sidelined for most of the season, but he won’t be carrying the entire load like folks are projecting. Steph’s pure talent and shooting ability are why he’s sitting top 5 on this list. He puts on a show every single night and remains one of the biggest draws in the NBA. Steph still has D’Angelo Russell and, of course, Draymond Green next to him. Seeing him in a James Harden-type role this year will be interesting, but I expect nothing less than an MVP-caliber season from Steph. <span class="byline">&#8212;Zion Olojede</span></div>

                    <div class="description">Making the case for the reigning NBA MVP as the league’s top player isn’t all that difficult. Antetokounmpo, only 24, is an exceptional two-way player that easily could’ve been the Defensive Player of the Year winner on top of earning the top individual award last season. He’s also the game’s most impressive physical specimen since he looks like he’s carved out of stone. Unlike the Greek gods he resembles, Antetokounmpo has a gigantic Achilles’ heel and it’s his putrid shooting from outside, most especially his career 27.7 percent clip from beyond the arc. Develop a consistent, knockdown jumper and Antetokounmpo will be unstoppable. But for the time being, it’s holding him back from being the game’s best player. He recently went on the record saying he doesn’t have to knock down the three consistently for the Bucks to be a championship team, but let’s be real here: He can’t shoot 25.6 percent from outside like he did last season if he really wants to elevate the Bucks past the Eastern Conference Finals. Become a legit spot-up shooter and Antetokounmpo could conceivably become the most dominant offensive force since Shaquille O’Neal during his Lakers days. <span class="byline">&#8212;Adam Caparell</span></div>

He’s efficient on offense and on defense only averaging 1.7 fouls a game and shooting 49 percent for his career. That’s a dangerous combination. If Leonard manages to take the city from LeBron, AD, and the Lakers while taking home a third Finals MVP, the history books will have to be rewritten. The quiet assassin will have another kill on his list while many will scramble to make excuses as to why he isn’t the best of the best. <span class="byline">&#8212;Angel Diaz</span></div>

                    <div class="description">This is honestly more about everyone else than it is about LeBron James. The accolades, stats, and production speak for itself with LeBron. He’s performed at an insane level for 17 years now and while he was a bit banged up last season, he doesn’t really look to be slowing down. And now that he has Anthony Davis as his running mate in Los Angeles, there’s a full expectation that No. 23 returns to MVP level. LeBron has been the best player in the NBA for years, and in my opinion, someone has to take it from him to bump the King from the No. 1 spot. Kevin Durant, who we did not include on this list because he’s set to miss the entire season with an injury, was probably the closest to taking the title of “Best Basketball Player in the World” from LeBron. They may have even been tied, but with KD's injury, there’s still a gap between James the level that Kawhi and Giannis are at. Kawhi and Giannis are great players, and the latter is the future of the league. But can you really sit there and say they’re better than James? We can’t, not yet at least. In his “down year” last season, LeBron still put up 27, 8, and 8 while surrounded by a flawed roster and a number of injuries. While health is a major factor as LeBron enters his age 35 season, his complete game is still what sets him on another level. Even in year 17, the King retains his throne. <span class="byline">&#8212;Chopz</span></div>
