For years I firmly believed there to be 52 states in America. Quite a shock when I found out there was only 50,</p><p>After this, I must have asked 25-30 people (in Europe, as I’m Irish), literally everbody I met, how many states in America. Every one said 52. After I said there was 50, their reaction remained ‘oh yea. wierd.’</p><p>Maybe theres another explanation for it, but occasionally I still ask and hear 52!</p><p>I encourage anybody reading this to ask people away from America (who wouldn’t know as readily) and see how many times 52 is replied!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Joy replied:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I’m from Portugal, and I thought it was 52 states in America too!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Victor agreed:</strong></p><blockquote><p>What the heck? I always thought there were 52 States in America. I’m from Brazil btw.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Jasper Allen (in the U.K.) said the same:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I was also taught at school that America had 52 states.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Siphakeme said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>i grew studying that the US has 52 states too</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kassia said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>52 States (I am European),etc, etc.</p></blockquote><p><strong>aragami agreed:</strong></p><blockquote><p>52 states in the US</p></blockquote><p><strong>miss_fionna said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I also remember being taught that there was 52 states with Alaska being number 51 (even though at this point I only remember there being 50, and that was over ten years ago.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kate said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I seem to have a fuzzy memory of 52 states as well. And i remembered it was 52, because it was the same as the number of cards in a deck. Suddenly at some point it was 50, and I remember thinking…I ‘know’ it was 52. Suddenly teachers were telling me…’You’re confusing this with the number of cards in a deck” which I thought was weird because that’s how we remembered it as kids.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Pam said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I can say that I live in the US and for some reason I could swear that 52 states has a familiarity. I know I have a couple times had to really think before I said 52 or 52 because I knew it was off somehow. Or I would reword my phrase to not mention a number because I just was not sure anymore.</p></blockquote><p><strong>David (who has an alternate Mandela memory) confirmed confusion about the states:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I am US History teacher in the US and my American students often mistakenly think there are 51 or 52 states at which I just shake my head and say,”kids today.”<br /> I think it’s because there was a lot of talk about Puerto Rico becoming a state, which would have been the 51st… but it hasn’t happened yet.</p></blockquote><p><strong>L. said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Also, I remember my mother always saying 52 states instead of 50 when I was growing up and getting annoyed because she was a teacher and thats such common knowledge.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Josh asked:</strong></p><blockquote><p>To the people who remember being taught about 52 States, do you remember the names of the other two?</p></blockquote><p><strong>miss_fiona said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I remember arguing with our teacher over the number because I had been taught that there was fifty until that point. According to her Hawaii was the 51st state, but I don’t remember what she said was the 52nd.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Hoss listed the 52 states as he recalls them, including Puerto Rico and D.C.:</strong></p><blockquote><p>1. Alabama, 2. Alaska, 3. Arizona, 4. Arkansas 5. Colorado 6. California, 7. Connecticut, 8. Delaware, 9. Florida, 10. Georgia, 11. Hawaii, 12. Illinois, 13. Indiana, 14. Idaho, 15. Iowa, 16. Kentucky, 17. Kansas, 18. Louisiana, 19. Massachusetts, 20. Maryland, 21. Mississippi, 22. Maine, 23. Missouri, 24. Michigan 25. Minnesota, 26. Montana, 27. New Jersey, 28. New York, 29. North Carolina 30. New Hampshire, 31. Nevada, 32. Nebraska, 33. North Dakota 34. New Mexico, 35. Oklahoma, 36. Ohio, 37. Oregon, 38. Pennsylvania, 39. Puerto Rico. 40. Rhode Island 41. South Carolina, 42. South Dakota, 43. Tennessee, 44. Texas, 45. Utah, 46. Virginia, 47. Vermont, 48. Wisconsin, 49. West Virginia, 50. Washington, 51. Wyoming, 52. Washington DC</p></blockquote><p>So, I think the question really is: In an alternate timeline, did Puerto Rico already become a state? Or, did the District of Columbia become one, separately or as well?</p><p>Or, is this simply confusion over districts, territories, and states?</p><p><em>Note:</em> Comments that say that there really <em>are</em> 50 states in this timestream, will be deleted. We already know that. That&#8217;s exactly why 51 or 52 states seem like an <em>anomaly,</em> and worth discussing at this website.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Illustration credit</em>: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Addicted04">Addicted04</a>, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_orthographic.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"> <span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=49&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=98&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-49 photo' height='49' width='49' /><span class="screen-reader-text">Author </span> <a class="url fn n" href="https://mandelaeffect.com/author/nfb18eibfiona/">Fiona Broome</a></span></span><span class="posted-on"><span class="screen-reader-text">Posted on </span><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2013-11-14T06:51:45+00:00">14 November 13</time><time class="updated" datetime="2019-02-22T18:11:39+00:00">22 February 19</time></a></span><span class="cat-links"><span class="screen-reader-text">Categories </span><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/category/alt-geog/" rel="category tag">Alternate Geography</a></span></footer></article><div id="comments" class="comments-area"><h2 class="comments-title"> 186 thoughts on &ldquo;51 or 52 United States?&rdquo;</h2><nav class="navigation comment-navigation" role="navigation" aria-label="Comments"><h2 class="screen-reader-text">Comments navigation</h2><div class="nav-links"><div class="nav-next"><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/comment-page-2/#comments" >Newer comments</a></div></div></nav><ol class="comment-list"><li id="comment-6182" class="comment even thread-even depth-1 parent"><article id="div-comment-6182" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/69a879facb6ec5f1eec0ad13c0f91384?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/69a879facb6ec5f1eec0ad13c0f91384?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Will</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6182"> <time datetime="2013-12-07T14:56:15+00:00"> 7 December 13 at 2:56 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>It sounds like teachers outside of the US do not address the difference in rights between a Federal US territory and a State US territory.

I remember it very clearly because I went home telling my parents that we now considered Hawaii and Alaska states. The entire class had to learn that there were now 52 states, and our teacher, Mr. Fox would sternly correct us if we slipped up and said 50. Then, out of the blue maybe 8 years later I started noticing that people always said we had 50 states and I remember thinking how dumb they must be. It took me years to accept that maybe I had for no reason had false memories that served zero purpose. I mean seriously, why would I remember it in such detail? What would be the possible gain my mind would get from creating such an obscure false memory? It happened.

This particular topic caught my attention.  I am an American.  I was in elementary school in the 80&#8217;s and very clearly remember learning there were 52 states.  I was and always have been obsessed with history and knowledge and was a very good student, especially in topics surrounding history.  I vividly remember having an argument with a fellow student over the number of states.  I believed there were 52.  He maintained there were 50 and eventually showed me in a text book the number of states in writing.  I had no choice but to let go of my previous education.  I did not consider it again until reading this article.  I can not recall what the other 2 states were.  Like many others I believed them to be Hawaii and Alaska, but did not learn Puerto Rico was a state.  I distinctly remember learning the difference between states and territories.  I have to say, I&#8217;m a tad relieved.  I had put it out of my mind, but I remember being completely thrown off by the proof that there were not 52 states.  It was however the driving force behind falling in love with research.</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6251" class="comment even depth-3 parent"><article id="div-comment-6251" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf2d4cd5472ecfafc87086ed12a5866?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf2d4cd5472ecfafc87086ed12a5866?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">bustercasey</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6251"> <time datetime="2015-03-22T10:30:21+00:00"> 22 March 15 at 10:30 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>i posted earlier  im an american iwas a history fanatic my whole life.

But I find it fascinating how widespread the notion of 52 states apparently is.

Yes, it&#8217;s had the strongest push for statehood among the territories, but that wouldn&#8217;t explain it being grouped with D.C.

Until I lived with an American who corrected this thought. I&#8217;m not sure why but this seems like a common misconception in Europe.</p><p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why this mistake is so common. I thought this could be because people are just getting the number of states wrong and repeating this error to others, or they are getting the number of states mixed up with the territories. However, when I investigated how many territories there are this didn&#8217;t quite add up. Even though I know there are only 50 states, 52 still feels right to me. The Mandela Effect seems to offers a reasonable explanation.</p><p>I really like the idea that these alternative memories are happenings leaching through from different time streams/universes.<br /> This got me thinking. If there are an infinite number universes with an infinite amount of possibilities, and there is no reason why the time streams in these universes run in sync. Is it feasible to consider that somewhere in the infinite number of universes there is an average universe influenced by the rest? In a constant state of flux at any one point along its own time stream, until the majority of universes have past that point. The inhabitants of such a universe would never be consciously aware of events changing, however may have remnant memories of events before they changed.</p><p>For example, Mandela may have died in prison. This is until the majority of universes have played out their version of events. In which the majority of universes had Mandela passing in 2013. The memories of Mandela passing in prison are perhaps remnant memories before the change.</p><p>Could this be the universe we inhabit? Could this offer an alternative explanation to the Mandela Effect?<br /> It would be great to hear everyone&#8217;s thoughts.</p></div></article></li><li id="comment-6214" class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><article id="div-comment-6214" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f1223fed3863f620dce439724b500bd7?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f1223fed3863f620dce439724b500bd7?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Lisa Love</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6214"> <time datetime="2014-09-17T19:12:32+00:00"> 17 September 14 at 7:12 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I also know their are 52 states!Ask someone what color is a yield sign!!!!!!

For tax purposes, the IRS considers the D.C.  as a state. But wait-the territories are the same for purposes of the IRS. So if there are 6 territories as someone said(even we Americans don&#8217;t know things like that) then there are, in a manner of speaking, 57. So maybe that explains Obama&#8217;s mistake. Or maybe it&#8217;s just because he&#8217;s Obama&#8230;<br /> That however does nothing to solve all the memories of 51 or 52 states.<br /> This question about the states does not interest me much because for me there have always been 50, and that&#8217;s that. But my mind was blown when I learned tonight that Mandela died in 2013. As far as I can recall, I had never heard that until like an hour ago. Until then, he died sometime while I was in school, in the 80&#8217;s or 90&#8217;s.</p></div></article></li></ol></li><li id="comment-6220" class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent"><article id="div-comment-6220" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5abb60d3f54f51c6d9a6ecc34d4cd45b?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5abb60d3f54f51c6d9a6ecc34d4cd45b?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Ash</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6220"> <time datetime="2014-10-28T13:53:27+00:00"> 28 October 14 at 1:53 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Ash from the US here, I always remember it being 50 states, but for some reason when I am asked how many states there are I immediately think of a deck of cards and want to say 52 which I find weird because I shouldn&#8217;t combine the two thoughts considering they are different numbers&#8230; unless they at one point were the same number (52).</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6237" class="comment odd alt depth-2"><article id="div-comment-6237" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a827f19b691a9ff98628ea0d8a32368?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a827f19b691a9ff98628ea0d8a32368?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">TrickyD</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6237"> <time datetime="2014-12-18T01:07:02+00:00"> 18 December 14 at 1:07 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Hey i had commented before I scrolled down the comments , I had said that when i was younger I was often confused about how many states there are and thought there was 52 same as a deck of cards.

At the grammar school I attended, we had at least one annual test where we had to label all US states and their capitals, all major European countries, all major oceans, and all of the continents.

What&#8217;s &#8220;easy history&#8221; for <em>you</em> is the <em>apparent</em> history in this timestream. It sounds like you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in this timestream, except for when you slid to where it&#8217;s Berenstein Bears, not Berenstain.</p><p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p><p>In your reality, you&#8217;ve always had 50 states. I&#8217;m old enough to vaguely recall 48, but <em>I have no doubt</em> that some people have been in a timestream with 51 or 52 states. That has to be kind of weird, every time they see a US flag and the number of stars looks wrong.</p><p>I believe that most Americans <em>do</em> know their own history&#8230; at least the one presented in mainstream history books. It&#8217;s kind of insulting when someone thinks we&#8217;re stupid or badly educated, or raises facile, generational walls to trivialize what &#8212; to me, anyway &#8212; is a very cool, intriguing phenomenon.</p><p>In fact, I resent it. I&#8217;m sympathetic to your views, of course. While the idea of parallel worlds isn&#8217;t exactly new &#8212; not to physicists, anyway &#8212; it can be deeply unsettling to people who&#8217;ve never considered this before. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s easier to default to the traditional right/wrong dichotomy, than the possibility that <em>everyone</em> (or nearly everyone) is right.</p><p>My late father-in-law hated traveling abroad. To him, they were all &#8220;foreigners.&#8221; They did things the &#8220;wrong&#8221; way. He was even miserable in England, convinced that &#8220;they&#8221; all walked on the &#8220;wrong&#8221; side of the sidewalk. So, after a certain point, he quit traveling outside the USA. That answer worked for him. He seemed to have a happier life.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not so easy with the Mandela Effect. Avoiding the intrusion of alternate realities <em>isn&#8217;t</em> simple. It may not even be possible. I mean, the reality you fell asleep in last night &#8212; the one where you&#8217;d put the car keys on the kitchen counter, like always &#8212; may not be the reality you woke up in, this morning. In <em>today&#8217;s</em> reality, you might always leave the car keys on a hook by the garage door. Finding that could take <em>hours,</em> if your usual reality didn&#8217;t even have a hook there.</p><p>Personally, I&#8217;m pretty happy waking up to a new, better habit, even if it&#8217;s disorienting at first. (Or, if I wake up to a not-so-smart habit, at least it&#8217;s a case of, &#8220;Ooh, isn&#8217;t that interesting!&#8221; &#8230; before I re/install a hook by the garage door and, thereafter, place the car keys there.)</p><p>For me, the Mandela Effect makes sense. It reduces the right/wrong conflicts. I like this.</p><p>However, it sounds like you&#8217;ve had few experiences with the Mandela Effect, so &#8212; to you &#8212; other memories are &#8220;wrong.&#8221; I understand that. A site like this must be very upsetting. Even disappointing, if it seems like evidence of deteriorating educational standards.</p><p>The answer is simple: Avoid websites like this one.

I remember it as 50, and of course, so many of my generation on the Internet remember &#8220;Fifty Nifty United States&#8230;&#8221; (reddit randomly breaks out into comment singing this song!) which I doubt they would teach overseas.  It really sounds as if many of these commenters might be referencing the same textbooks or series of textbooks; something that would not have been used in the US itself.</p><p>One possibility is that we had a series of textbooks with misprints, and in the era before the Internet, teachers and students alike took it at face value.  After all, I have no idea how many provinces Canada has or how many states Mexico has, even if I can name a few.  In fact, even today, if I read a number for states/provinces about any country in a textbook, I wouldn&#8217;t have bothered to even look it up or verify it unless it was part of some assignment needing outside resources.</p><p>But the question then becomes, what about the Americans who remember something else?  And here we have a very good opportunity to put the Mandela effect to a test &#8211; if people remember Puerto Rico or Washington DC being states, then they most likely covered the history of those territories becoming states at some point in school.  After all, in the course of my entire K-12 education, we covered the details pertaining to statehoods of ALL 50 states &#8211; and furthermore, we would have memorized their capitols and labelled them on maps.  So naturally, an American student would have done the same, for no matter how many states there were in their timeline.</p><p>THOSE are the memories I am interested in hearing about.  It is extremely easy for someone to misremember a number &#8211; and I have seen videos of people answering anywhere from 47 to 53 when it comes to &#8220;how many states are there&#8221;.  The simple mistake of a number does not give us any sort of substantial proof of a timeline shift.  But all the other memories contain therein would!  The substantial memories would have been the background education ON those states that only American children would have received.  Fiona, I would implore you to get back to those US commenters for more information about their US History education.  It would be extremely interesting to hear what they have to say.</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6301" class="comment even depth-2"><article id="div-comment-6301" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2afb5651c48efd2bcacbfcaed5d63f1?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2afb5651c48efd2bcacbfcaed5d63f1?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Seth</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6301"> <time datetime="2015-08-10T20:11:04+00:00"> 10 August 15 at 8:11 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I agree with this. For most outside of the US this can be chalked up to misinformation presented during a time when access to information was not as common. If your textbook said there were 52 states there is no reason to believe otherwise. All over the news these past weeks have been reports about textbooks in Texas saying things that simply aren&#8217;t true, in that case to further a political agenda. I actually think it is the same for those who remember Mandela dying but don&#8217;t live in South Africa or a neighboring nation. I know we all recall a year before his death in this timestream when everyone thought he was going to die but then he hung on another year. I feel like the childhood memories of people largely unfamiliar with the man might simply be a case of remembering news about a near death or something similar. The interesting accounts are the ones from people in the US for the 50 States thing and from people in South Africa for Mandela as it is much harder to disregard their memories as simple misinformation when surely the &#8220;real&#8221; information would be readily available.</p></div></article></li></ol></li><li id="comment-6242" class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 parent"><article id="div-comment-6242" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fae5dcf5f7ca49208fef507833309611?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fae5dcf5f7ca49208fef507833309611?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Monica Partridge</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6242"> <time datetime="2015-02-28T14:10:10+00:00"> 28 February 15 at 2:10 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I am tripping right now!!

New Brunswick as a state also included what we now know as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, it&#8217;s capital was Halifax and it was given us after we defeated England in war we fought against them from 1865-1867. Veracruz was a state that sat below Arizona and New Mexico and is named after the same Mexican State that we swapped Baja California for sometime in 1880s. It&#8217;s capital was Santo Carlos. Vermont it&#8217;s own independent country didn&#8217;t become state until 1876, the 100th Anniversary of the signing of Declaration Of Independence. Up until age of thirteen, fourteen, this is how I remember things before everything started to change around me and I ended up here, same person, same friends, same family, different place &#8230; :-S</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6246" class="comment byuser comment-author-nfb18eibfiona bypostauthor even depth-2 parent"><article id="div-comment-6246" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn"><a href='http://fionabroome.com/' rel='external nofollow ugc' class='url'>Fiona Broome</a></b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6246"> <time datetime="2015-03-12T04:19:58+00:00"> 12 March 15 at 4:19 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Interesting trivia!</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6252" class="comment odd alt depth-3"><article id="div-comment-6252" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf2d4cd5472ecfafc87086ed12a5866?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf2d4cd5472ecfafc87086ed12a5866?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">bustercasey</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6252"> <time datetime="2015-03-22T11:01:59+00:00"> 22 March 15 at 11:01 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>YESSS !!<br /> I  remember  that song also.</p></div></article></li></ol></li><li id="comment-6247" class="comment byuser comment-author-nfb18eibfiona bypostauthor even depth-2"><article id="div-comment-6247" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn"><a href='http://fionabroome.com/' rel='external nofollow ugc' class='url'>Fiona Broome</a></b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6247"> <time datetime="2015-03-15T09:37:02+00:00"> 15 March 15 at 9:37 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Johnny Ray, I believe Kate&#8217;s links tacitly suggest an increased likelihood that those memories exist, in fact, in another reality.</p></div></article></li></ol></li><li id="comment-6249" class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent"><article id="div-comment-6249" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97c3324ec0822ba72839e6cda40ff2c2?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97c3324ec0822ba72839e6cda40ff2c2?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">wolframdioxide</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6249"> <time datetime="2015-03-17T20:36:52+00:00"> 17 March 15 at 8:36 pm </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I distinctly recall the capital of Georgia being at Augusta, not Atlanta.

I stumbled upon something earlier today that I thought was worth mentioning.  If you google: 52 State Maps, the third one down is a link to a Garmin Map database that lists 52 states with Washington DC and Puerto Rico being the extras.  Also Will mentioned that you could count the number of provinces on your fingers and Fiona replied that Canada had 10 Provinces and 3 Territories.  Which seemed kind of high for me, but I brushed it off, but then Eric mentioned being taught that Canada had 4 provinces that were all rectangular shaped, and bells immediately started going off in my head.  I pulled up a map of Canada, and it looks nothing like what I remember from school. I was taught that there were only 4 provinces(Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British columbia).</p><p>Also at one point there were 2 other US territories that almost became states(Puerto Rico and Cuba), but they didn&#8217;t get enough votes in the legislature.  If they would have been voted to become states then Alaska and Hawaii would have been 51 and 52.</p></div></article></li><li id="comment-6260" class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1"><article id="div-comment-6260" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bf54616a3ed28e4f5d0d960b089134?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bf54616a3ed28e4f5d0d960b089134?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Courtney</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6260"> <time datetime="2015-06-02T11:11:56+00:00"> 2 June 15 at 11:11 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I stumbled on this site because someone on another site said to google it.

Sam Houston was never ousted as president/governor, Central TX didn&#8217;t enter the civil war, Clark took over South and was assassinated in 1867, and Francis Lubbock over North Texas.</p><p>Two years later I learned an entirely different history of Texas, and that the US only had 50 states.</p><p>On that note, I also remember that Cuba and Puerto Rico were allies and we hated both of them, so I am always amazed when I hear PR is a territory.</p><p>I kinda wish you wouldn&#8217;t publish this because even I know how crazy it is.</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6271" class="comment byuser comment-author-nfb18eibfiona bypostauthor even depth-2 parent"><article id="div-comment-6271" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1cdbe98db032ae670ef61569b9ef6054?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn"><a href='http://fionabroome.com/' rel='external nofollow ugc' class='url'>Fiona Broome</a></b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6271"> <time datetime="2015-06-29T05:56:58+00:00"> 29 June 15 at 5:56 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Elle, if you&#8217;d like me to un-approve this (conceal it) and place it in the <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/share-your-other-memories-here-in-confidence" rel="nofollow">Shared/In Confidence list</a>, let me know.</p><p>Cheerfully, Fiona</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6321" class="comment odd alt depth-3"><article id="div-comment-6321" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c28d2c452cd22509956fe2a2027224e?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c28d2c452cd22509956fe2a2027224e?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">elle</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6321"> <time datetime="2015-09-15T01:06:00+00:00"> 15 September 15 at 1:06 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>Hey it&#8217;s okay.

I too was trying to write down the 50 states from memory and was shocked to find out I had missed one (Montana).  I also knew that Puerto Rico and Guam weren&#8217;t there yet,<br /> I might add that I am a proud 45 yr old Canadian!<br /> What I find hilarious is that while we had to learn American geography, Americans never had to learn  much about Canada. I worked in the tourism area of Niagara Falls and was stunned by some comments and questions we got on a daily basis. It appears that the further south you were from the border, the less you were taught. This is not at all meant as an insult as I know some incredibly intelligent people from the south, it&#8217;s a matter of what you were taught about Canada. How else would you explain prople showing up the first week in July with skis strapped to the roof of their cars? Or someone expecting snow and igloos the moment they crossed the border (I&#8217;ve lived in Canada my whole life and have never seen an igloo!)? Just so you&#8217;re aware, Niagara Falls is further south than the entire state of Minnesota!<br /> My point is, the further away from a country you are, the less you seem to know. I find it perfectly reasonable then, that Europeans do not know how many states there are. I truly couldn&#8217;t tell you much about even Mexico other than its capitol, their language, and that it looks like a lovely place to vacation. Most European countries, I couldn&#8217;t even tell you that!<br /> Cheers all 🙂</p></div></article></li><li id="comment-6276" class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1"><article id="div-comment-6276" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cb015124079b59125a93ac2fcbe2f423?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cb015124079b59125a93ac2fcbe2f423?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Robynne</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6276"> <time datetime="2015-07-03T11:15:40+00:00"> 3 July 15 at 11:15 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>BTW<br /> Canada is part of the British commonwealth and I still don&#8217;t know the difference between the United Kingdom and Great Britain further proving my geographic location theory.</p></div></article></li><li id="comment-6277" class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><article id="div-comment-6277" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6531d99c38965a3e262b2c33dea863cf?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6531d99c38965a3e262b2c33dea863cf?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">Wild Woman</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6277"> <time datetime="2015-07-06T09:24:45+00:00"> 6 July 15 at 9:24 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>I also was taught that there were 52 states and that Alaska and Hawaii were the 51st and 52nd states.

She specifically taught us this&#8221;&#8216;fact&#8221; and gave the dates when these two states were added.  Guam and Puerto Rico  were also sited as territories by this teacher and the District of Columbia was only a district.  So where did she get her information to teach us this inaccuracy?

I too want to say 52 US States and at the same time I realize it does not sound quite right.  Reading all the comments here I can see how maybe my confusion came from the teachers teaching about territories and districts at the same time as discussion about the number of states there were.  It would have been easy for a teacher to suggest 52 states in the discussion by adding Puerto Rico and DC to the mix during the years I was learning US Geography and that would mean I got stuck on 52.  The attempt to teach us about Territories and Districts and States all at the same time would create the confusion.  I bet teachers even knew and purposely made 51 and 52 choices on multiple choice questions for tests!  creating even more confusion for those of us with bad memories.</p></div></article></li><li id="comment-6280" class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1"><article id="div-comment-6280" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/63fca3664f2bb4622d7a32edae75cf39?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/63fca3664f2bb4622d7a32edae75cf39?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">W.

And it would of course tip power to the state that mainly controls the new state. But Puerto Rico is a whole different story, they are currently a distract but i at first when little didnt even know this. But then i found out it was a part of the us. And i began to think it was a state. But when i was around 12 i found out it was a district, but a district in my eyes is basically a state waiting for approval. And will soon be turned into a state. So get ready for the 51st state one day everybody, last state introduced was hawaii in 1959. Of course different senators and congressmen have tried to keep bringing up the bill to get D.C. to become a state as well. We actually might have 52 states in the end.</p></div></article><ol class="children"><li id="comment-6287" class="comment odd alt depth-2"><article id="div-comment-6287" class="comment-body"><footer class="comment-meta"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e7f17ce888cdd97a5b75b251c5ad67c?s=42&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e7f17ce888cdd97a5b75b251c5ad67c?s=84&#038;d=blank&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-42 photo' height='42' width='42' /> <b class="fn">daniel</b> <span class="says">says:</span></div><div class="comment-metadata"> <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/#comment-6287"> <time datetime="2015-08-01T06:53:37+00:00"> 1 August 15 at 6:53 am </time> </a></div></footer><div class="comment-content"><p>i know i had some misspellings please forgive me.</p></div></article></li></ol></li></ol><nav class="navigation comment-navigation" role="navigation" aria-label="Comments"><h2 class="screen-reader-text">Comments navigation</h2><div class="nav-links"><div class="nav-next"><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/51-52-united-states/comment-page-2/#comments" >Newer comments</a></div></div></nav><p class="no-comments">Comments are closed.</p></div><nav class="navigation post-navigation" role="navigation" aria-label="Posts"><h2 class="screen-reader-text">Post navigation</h2><div class="nav-links"><div class="nav-previous"><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/ernest-borgnine/" rel="prev"><span class="meta-nav" aria-hidden="true">Previous</span> <span class="screen-reader-text">Previous post:</span> <span class="post-title">Ernest Borgnine</span></a></div><div class="nav-next"><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/history-explain-alternate-geographical-memories/" rel="next"><span class="meta-nav" aria-hidden="true">Next</span> <span class="screen-reader-text">Next post:</span> <span class="post-title">Does History Explain Alternate Geographical Memories?</span></a></div></div></nav></main></div><aside id="secondary" class="sidebar widget-area" role="complementary"><section id="search-3" class="widget widget_search"><h2 class="widget-title">Search</h2><form role="search" method="get" class="search-form" action="https://mandelaeffect.com/"> <label> <span class="screen-reader-text">Search for:</span> <input type="search" class="search-field" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s" /> </label> <button type="submit" class="search-submit"><span class="screen-reader-text">Search</span></button></form></section><section id="custom_html-2" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html"><h2 class="widget-title">Broken links?</h2><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget">As I'm reducing the content - and bandwidth requirements for this site - some links will be broken.</div></section><section id="text-10" class="widget widget_text"><h2 class="widget-title">Have you read these?</h2><div class="textwidget"><p><a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/most-popular-topics/">The Top 10 Most Popular Mandela Effects</a> (updated hourly)</p></div></section><section id="text-9" class="widget widget_text"><h2 class="widget-title">IMPORTANT</h2><div class="textwidget"><p>If you continue to use this website, I&#8217;ll assume you have read &amp;
