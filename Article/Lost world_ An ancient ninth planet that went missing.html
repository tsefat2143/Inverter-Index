        <div id="ember282994" class="article-text -drop-cap ember-view">  <p>Our solar system is like a 4.6-billion-year-old crime scene.</p>

<p>Crater-ridden surfaces, misaligned planetary orbits and streams of interplanetary debris are the cosmic equivalents of blood spatters on the wall and skid marks from a getaway car. These and other clues tell of a chaotic beginning for our planetary family.</p>

<p>Buried in those clues are hints of a lost sibling: a ninth planet (no, not Pluto) that was kicked away in a gravitational tug-of-war that reshaped the early solar system.</p>

<p>Today, the outer solar system is dominated by four giant worlds: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Beyond them lies the Kuiper belt, a field of icy debris that counts Pluto among its residents.</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t fall into the trap of looking at the outer solar system and thinking it was always like that,” says David Nesvorný, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/742/2/L22/meta" target="_blank">who first made the case for a runaway planet in 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Nesvorný is one of a cadre of scientists trying to figure out how the solar system evolved in its first few hundred million years. Using complex computer simulations, researchers had assembled a narrative in which the infant planets formed relatively close together and then jockeyed for position, alternately gliding and leaping from one orbit to another. Those simulations explained many of the minute details about how the planets, asteroids and comets orbit the sun today.</p>

<p>Except there was one problem. The story usually ended with <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-052028" target="_blank">either Uranus or Neptune getting kicked out of the solar system</a>, Nesvorný writes in September in the <em>Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>.</p>

<p>Since Uranus and Neptune are quite clearly still present — spacecraft have visited both worlds, after all — that tale didn’t quite hold together. But a fifth giant planet, many researchers suspect, could be the hero that this mystery needs, and a critical missing player in the history of the solar system.</p>

<h2>A phantom planet</h2>

<p>To re-create these ancient scenes, astronomers rely on computer simulations to generate thousands of different solar systems in thousands of different ways. In lines of code, they lay out the laws of physics and the starting lineup of any planetary arrangement they can imagine. The researcher sets the stage — drop a planet here, sprinkle some asteroids there — then steps back and lets simulated nature take its course. After a couple of weeks in the real world — in which millions of years play out in the simulation — the astronomer peeks inside to see how the solar system turned out. The closer it is to the real thing, the better.</p>

<p>Lost sibling: Was a ninth planet (no, not Pluto) kicked away in a gravitational tug-of-war that reshaped the early solar system?</p>
</div>

<p>This is what Nesvorný was doing in 2009. He was playing around with virtual solar systems, trying to figure out a way to save virtual Uranus and virtual Neptune from a one-way trip into virtual deep space.</p>

<p>The problem was Jupiter. The giant planet is a bully, whose gravity can reach far and wide to push around smaller worlds and assorted debris. In the most successful simulations of the time, Jupiter and one of the two outermost planets ricocheted off each other and eventually settled into their modern orbits. But that only occurred about one percent of the time. In the other 99 percent of cases, Jupiter flung Uranus or Neptune so hard that they left the solar system, never to return.</p>

<p>“That makes things weird, because we know Uranus and Neptune survived,” Nesvorný says. So he kept tinkering. After a year of trying countless different scenarios, he started playing with the idea of adding martyr worlds: extra planets sacrificed to save the others.</p>

<p>“I would run these simulations just to see what would happen, not taking them too seriously,” Nesvorný says. “But then I realized there might be some truth in them.” He ran roughly 10,000 simulations, changing the number of extra planets, their starting locations and their masses in each one.</p>

<p>The best scenario — the one that reproduced a solar system that most closely resembles the real one — was one with <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117/meta" target="_blank">an extra planet that lived between the original orbits of Saturn and Uranus</a>. The world was roughly as massive as Uranus and Neptune, or about 16 times as massive as Earth. It was this planet that could have gotten tangled with Jupiter’s orbit and been tossed out of the solar system.</p>

          <figcaption><p>A plot shows how each giant planet’s average distance from the sun has changed over time.

The dashed lines mark the modern sizes of the orbits. </p>

      </figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The odds still aren’t great. Repeated simulations of this setup worked only about five percent of the time. “The present solar system is neither a typical nor expected result,” Nesvorný wrote in a 2012 paper exploring the idea, cowritten by his colleague Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatory of the Côte d’Azur in France. But it was a significant improvement over the one-percent success rate of simulations that included only the four giant planets we know and love today.</p>

<p>“Invoking the existence of a fifth [giant] planet is actually much simpler than not,” says Sean Raymond, a planetary scientist at the University of Bordeaux in France. While the evidence is largely circumstantial, “it makes a lot more sense to have had an extra one back then.”</p>

<p>That may seem like a stretch. How can astronomers know anything about what happened more than 4 billion years ago with the planets that we do have, much less ones that aren’t even here? Turns out, the planets left behind plenty of battle scars from their youth for planetary detectives to try to interpret.</p>

<h2>Interplanetary blood splatters</h2>

<p>“We are very certain that the planets didn’t form where they are today,” says Nathan Kaib, a planetary scientist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. </p>

<p>This realization was quite recent, though. For most of history, stargazers assumed that the planets had always followed their existing orbits. But in the early 1990s, researchers realized that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/365819a0" target="_blank">something was amiss</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/365819a0" target="_blank"> in this scenario</a>.</p>

<p>“We are very certain that the planets didn’t form where they are today.”</p>

<p>Just past the orbit of Neptune lies the Kuiper belt, a splash of icy debris encircling the sun. “They are the blood splatters on the wall,” says California Institute of Technology planetary scientist Konstantin Batygin.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the Kuiper belt objects led researchers to an inescapable conclusion: Neptune had to have formed closer to the sun than it is today. Many of the objects in the Kuiper belt clump together in concentric orbits, vaguely resembling the grooves in a record. And these aren’t just random orbits — they are linked directly to Neptune’s.</p>

<p>Take Pluto, the Kuiper belt’s most famous resident. It and a couple hundred of its known companions go around the sun exactly twice for every three trips that Neptune makes. Other streams of Kuiper objects go around once for every two of Neptune’s revolutions, or four for every seven.</p>

<p>There’s no way for the Kuiper belt to end up that way on its own. If, however, Neptune formed closer to the sun and then moseyed outward, its gravity would have acted like a net, trapping nearby interplanetary debris in these special orbits and bringing it along for the ride.</p>

          <figcaption><p>This simulation shows how a compact configuration for the outer planets (left) might evolve over time. Jupiter and Saturn sync their orbits (middle), which causes the orbits of all the planets to change. In this particular run, Uranus and Neptune swap places. Over time, (right) debris scatters, some of it settling in the Kuiper belt, as the planets head toward their modern orbits.</p>

      </figcaption></figure></div>

<p>This matched what some simulations <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103584901015?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">hinted at the</a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103584901015?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"> decade before</a>. Planet formation was a messy business that left debris scattered all over the solar system. Any fragments that came too close to Neptune would have been steered by the planet’s gravity. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, each time Neptune nudged a fragment, the planet would have been pushed in the opposite direction. Over time Neptune would have crawled slowly away from the sun.</p>

<p>Neptune’s migration implicates the other giant planets as well. After all, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus were plowing through the same field of debris and dealing with similar gravitational interactions. If Neptune moved, then all the giant planets had to have moved.</p>

<p>And it couldn’t have been a smooth ride.</p>

<p>The incessant grind from all this debris should have sculpted the orbits of the giant planets into perfect, aligned circles, much the way clay on a potter’s wheel is smoothed out by the potter’s steady hand. That’s not how the orbits ended up, though. The giant planets instead travel on orbits that are slightly elongated and askew. It’s as if someone bumped into the wheel, deforming the once-round pots.</p>

<h2>Jumping Jupiter</h2>

<p>By 2005, researchers had uncovered a culprit. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03539" target="_blank">New simulations</a> indicated that at some point the giant planets must have undergone what scientists call a “dynamical instability.” In other words, things got crazy for about a million years. The most likely source seemed to be <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=bibcode&amp;amp;bibcode=&amp;amp;bibcode=2009A%26A...507.1041MFUL" target="_blank">a series of close encounters between Saturn and either Uranus or Neptune</a> — a.k.a. the ice giants — which sent one of these two worlds toward Jupiter. As the wayward world approached, its gravity pulled back on Jupiter, slowing down the giant planet and dropping it to a lower orbit. But Jupiter pulled on the encroaching planet just as hard. The ice giant, being much lighter, sped up far more than Jupiter slowed down, redirecting it away from the sun.</p>

<p>This altercation was like a gravitational wallop to the solar system. Jupiter jumped inward while the rest of the outer planets leaped outward. This kick would have contorted the orbits of the giant planets into their modern poses. It also would have saved the inner solar system — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and the asteroid belt — from being messed up by prolonged gravitational meddling from both Jupiter and Saturn, another problem that had arisen in earlier simulations.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the removal of Uranus or Neptune. It’s at this point in the simulations that Jupiter, more often than not, drop-kicks an ice giant out into the galaxy.</p>

<p>This is the dilemma that Nesvorný was trying to solve without breaking everything else about the simulations that <em>did</em> work. An extra ice giant takes the brunt of Jupiter’s bullying while letting the other events in the narrative unfold unimpeded.</p>

<p>“It’s completely plausible,” says Batygin. “[If you] ask is there any reason why we should have two instead of three ice giants, the answer is absolutely not.” In fact, he says, some calculations indicate that <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/423612/meta" target="_blank">as many as five Neptune-like worlds could have formed initially</a>.</p>

<p>Batygin and colleagues were exploring this question at the same time as Nesvorný, though their motives were different. “I wanted to demonstrate that there could <em>not</em> have been an extra giant planet,” he says.</p>

<p>He reasoned that this supposed planet, on its way out of the solar system, would have messed up a part of the Kuiper belt known as the cold classical belt. If the Kuiper belt were a donut, Batygin says, the cold classical belt would be the chocolate filling — a family of objects whose orbits lie nearly flat within the Kuiper belt. A passing planet should have stirred up those orbits, or so Batygin and colleagues thought.</p>

<p>Their computer simulations showed that it did no such thing. To their surprise, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/744/1/L3/meta" target="_blank">an ejected planet would not have destroyed the cold classical belt</a>. It doesn’t prove the planet existed, just that the solar system works whether it was there or not. Could this planet have left a more direct signature? Or back to the crime scene analogy, are there any skid marks? Nesvorný thinks there might be.</p>

<h2>A kernel of a clue</h2>

<p>There is another part of the Kuiper belt called the kernel, a narrow stream of icy fragments whose orbits are not currently synced to Neptune’s. Its origin is a bit of a mystery. In 2015, Nesvorný argued that <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/150/3/68/meta" target="_blank">a jump in Neptune’s outward migration</a> — caused by an ejected planet — could be responsible.</p>

<p>As Neptune trekked to its final orbit and swept up debris into orbits synced to its own, a “bump” at the right time could have released some of that debris, leaving it to become an independent stream, like the kernel. Simulations showed that the gravitational kick that made Jupiter jump and tossed out the extra planet would have happened at the right time to whack Neptune as well.</p>

<p>“You end up with something like the kernel,” Nesvorný says. “It’s circumstantial evidence … but it’s not conclusive.”</p>

<p>The truth is, we may never know exactly what went down in the solar system’s formative years. “We can’t write a solar system bible,” Batygin says. “We can only give a very murky story.”</p>

<p>If the solar system did kick out one of its own, it’s in good company. In recent years, astronomers have found a handful of rogue planets adrift between the stars, most likely ejected from their homes. With some extrapolation, “these observations show that there are more free-floating, Jupiter-sized planets in the galaxy than there are stars,” Nesvorný says.</p>

<p>That might be an overstatement — recent estimates <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23276" target="_blank">put the number at closer to one rogue Jupiter for every four stars</a> — but that’s still billions of wandering worlds. And those are just the ones as large as Jupiter. Our rogue was likely smaller, about the size of Neptune, and we have no idea how many of those are roaming the galaxy. But we do know that the universe tends to favor small things over large things.</p>

<p>“I bet there will be many,” Nesvorný says. Plus astronomers have discovered thousands of planetary systems in the Milky Way, and many of them show signs of dustups far more dramatic than our own. “It’s surprising,” he says, “how organized the solar system has remained.”</p>

She notes that in 2011, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, which promotes reliable study methods, determined that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CEBM-Levels-of-Evidence-2.1.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eN of 1 trials deserved a “level 1” rating\u003c/a\u003e — the highest level of evidence possible — for assessing treatments of individual patients.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“There has been a lot of misunderstanding in the research world,” McDonald says. “People think that N of 1 studies aren’t scientifically rigorous or that they’re just anecdotal.

But instead of taking a few measurements from many people, researchers can conduct many measurements from one person over time. A study might compare the results of two different interventions, perhaps two different pain medications or two different diets. Or it might compare an intervention to a placebo to see if a treatment had any real effect beyond wishful thinking. Throughout the process, the subject often has the power to change the approach and goal of the study to meet their own needs.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"A graphic outlines a hypothetical N of 1 study design.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/394/G-hypothetical-n-of-1-trial.svg\\\" title=\\\"A hypothetical N of 1 study design\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis chart shows how a hypothetical trial of just one person can provide meaningful results with far-reaching implications when pooled with many other individual experiences. A single patient took either the active drug or a placebo every morning for six days and reported their pain and changes in function (meaning the ability to perform daily tasks). In a typical randomized clinical trial, half of the patients are given placebos and half are given the active treatment; in an N of 1 trial, the patient is assured of receiving the active drug on at least some treatment days. The patient is also in control of which outcomes are measured. For this patient, the drug outperformed the placebo for pain relief but the effect on function was less conclusive. At right, combining results from 50 individuals who followed the same procedure allows scientists to gauge the bigger picture: The drug shows promise for relieving pain relief but not for improving function.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCombining those results can provide the same sort of insights as a multiple-person clinical trial. In 2018, a team of researchers in the Netherlands, the UK and the US \u003ca href=\\\"https://n.neurology.org/content/90/15_Supplement/P3.440\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eaggregated results from placebo-controlled N of 1 trials\u003c/a\u003e of 27 patients to show that the drug mexiletine effectively relieved myotonia (prolonged muscle contractions) in patients with a rare muscle disease. To validate the approach, the researchers compared the results to a more typical randomized control trial. The results were similar, adding a layer of confidence in the N of 1 results. The researchers noted that N of 1 studies could be especially helpful for testing treatments for rare conditions that, by definition, don’t lend themselves to large-scale studies involving many patients.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMcDonald is the cochair of the \u003ca href=\\\"https://nof1andsced.wixsite.com/home\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eInternational Collaborative Network for N-of-1 Clinical Trials and Single-Case Experimental Designs\u003c/a\u003e, a community of about 200 researchers, clinicians and members of the public who share study ideas and highlight recent results from around the world.

In 2017, she and colleagues published a study that used a series of N of 1 investigations to \u003ca href=\\\"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0623-7\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003esee if predictors of physical activity changed after retirement\u003c/a\u003e. “For some people, it was tied to how much sleep they got the night before, and for others it was their mood,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eOvercoming limitations\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOther potential studies are still under discussion. In the July 2019 issue of \u003cem\u003eFrontiers in Nutrition\u003c/em\u003e, Spanish researchers made the case that N of 1 studies could be an effective way to investigate nutritional interventions for \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2019.00110/full\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eimproving cognitive function and slowing decline in patients with\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2019.00110/full\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003e dementia\u003c/a\u003e. As the authors note, creating a classic randomized control trial for this issue would be daunting: Even without the complication of dementia it’s difficult to get people to adhere to diets they were assigned at random. But by using computer-assisted food diaries or perhaps blood tests to confirm dietary patterns, researchers could conduct cognitive tests and compare results to a baseline.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"pull-quote -left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e“People think that N of 1 studies aren’t scientifically rigorous or that they’re just anecdotal.

Importantly, there wouldn’t be any sort of control group; the best researchers can do is track changes in cognitive skills over time. And any variations in diet between subjects would complicate attempts to combine results. Still, as more and more patients participate, the aggregated results would provide a more detailed picture of the link between food and cognitive function, which might not be possible with a more traditional study.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eIndividual patients, individual approaches\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs Schork explains, the N of 1 approach appreciates and embraces the fact that what works for one person may not work for another. Differences in our genes, our habits and even our microbial communities can influence the impact of all sorts of interventions and treatments. By studying individuals instead of groups, researchers can learn more about which quirks really matter for the big picture. If a large number of N of 1 studies showed, for instance, that people with certain genetic markers responded well to a particular diet, that diet could be recommended to others with that marker. “Finding the differences that matter versus the ones that we can ignore — that’s where all of the action is,” Schork says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome patients are using N of 1 studies to get a better understanding of their own conditions. Sara Riggare, a PhD student in health informatics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29064509\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003edesigned a study in which she was the one and only patient\u003c/a\u003e. Riggare, who has Parkinson’s disease, tested the effects of nicotine on her levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a common and troubling side effect of Parkinson’s medication.

A study might compare the results of two different interventions, perhaps two different pain medications or two different diets.

Differences in our genes, our habits and even our microbial communities can influence the impact of all sorts of interventions and treatments. By studying individuals instead of groups, researchers can learn more about which quirks really matter for the big picture. If a large number of N of 1 studies showed, for instance, that people with certain genetic markers responded well to a particular diet, that diet could be recommended to others with that marker. “Finding the differences that matter versus the ones that we can ignore — that’s where all of the action is,” Schork says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome patients are using N of 1 studies to get a better understanding of their own conditions.

And as scientists understand more precisely which levers exercise pulls to improve our health, clinicians are on the verge of being able to change their practice. The goal is to think of exercise as a medicine — a therapy that they can prescribe in specific doses for specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s like your own personal regenerative medicine,” says Joyner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrain gains\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists have long known that some of the benefits of exercise are a simple matter of plumbing. Exercise makes blood vessels bigger and keeps them functioning smoothly, which makes them less likely to plug up and cause a heart attack or stroke. There have been hints that this may also mean more blood flow to the brain, which could help prevent cognitive decline. For example, studies have linked exercise to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow researchers are making a more explicit connection between exercise and brain health. They are discovering that the full benefit of exercise comes not from mere physical movement but from actual physical fitness, the body’s cardiovascular health.

Usually, when other organ systems need amino acids, says Bamman, “those are drawn from muscle.” That’s especially important when someone is sick because the immune system needs lots of amino acids to make antibodies that fight infection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest benefit from building muscle, though, may come from the signaling molecules it pumps into the blood. Bente Klarlund Pedersen, an exercise physiologist at the University of Copenhagen, identified the most-studied of these signaling molecules back in 2000, and later coined a term for them: myokines. Since then, she and other researchers have found hundreds more, many of which are activated by exercise. These molecules, which are released in response to muscular exertion, help regulate muscle growth, nutrient metabolism, inflammation and a host of other processes. “I think for most people it’s difficult to understand why muscle work can influence my liver or be good for my brain or bones,” she says. Myokines serve as the link between muscle activity and these other organs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important myokines in this crosstalk is interleukin-6.

In a recent experiment, Pedersen and her colleagues put 27 potbellied volunteers on a 12-week exercise-bike program, while 26 other volunteers remained inactive. Half the participants in each group also received a drug that blocks the action of IL-6.

Several studies already point in this direction. For example, more than half of 64 adults with type 2 diabetes were able to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2648632\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003estop taking medication to lower their blood sugar\u003c/a\u003e within a year of beginning a regular exercise program, Pedersen and her team found. And a survey of more than 300 randomized controlled trials found that \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5577\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eexercise was just as effective as drugs \u003c/a\u003efor people at risk of heart disease and diabetes, and was more effective than drugs for rehab after a stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if exercise is to truly become a medicine like any other, clinicians will need to learn how much to prescribe to maximize its benefits. “Just saying ‘be physically active’ is like telling people ‘eat better’ — it doesn’t tell us what we should be doing,” says Kirk Erickson, an exercise psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh. But developing more precise dosing recommendations is difficult, because there are so many ways to exercise, which vary in duration, intensity, frequency and kind. (Tailoring to individual disease risks — telling one person to do \u003cem\u003eX\u003c/em\u003e  because they’re at risk of diabetes, and another person to do \u003cem\u003eY\u003c/em\u003e  because of a family history of dementia — is an even more distant goal.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearchers are still working out what matters in this complex arena. Exercises that involve more muscle groups generate more IL-6, so full-body exercises like running have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than exercises that target just a few muscle groups, says Pedersen. And the benefits go away within a couple of days, suggesting that exercising frequently is important. “If it’s been 48 hours since you exercised, it’s time to do it again,” says Jill Barnes, an exercise physiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of upcoming randomized trials may soon bring more certainty to the dosing question. One of the largest, which Bamman is involved with at the University of Alabama, will have nearly 2,000 volunteers undertaking either 12 weeks of endurance exercise, 12 weeks of weight training or no exercise program. Researchers will measure gene activity, molecular signaling and other changes within the body, which could allow them to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://motrpac.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003epin down exactly how these two modes of exercise differ \u003c/a\u003ein effect. Because the study is so large, researchers should also be able to explore why some people respond more strongly than others to the same dose of exercise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother large study that Bamman is participating in, funded by the US Department of Defense, aims to compare \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03380923\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003egenes activated by moderate exercise to those activated by high-intensity exercise \u003c/a\u003ein young, healthy volunteers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eErickson is trying to parse the specifics with a study that will assess the \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02875301\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eeffect of exercise volume on brain aging\u003c/a\u003e. Researchers will measure inflammation, signaling molecules, body composition and other markers, as well as mental acuity, on more than 600 volunteers ages 65 to 80, both before and after a year of exercise. Some of the volunteers will do 150 minutes per week of supervised moderate exercise, others will do 225 minutes per week, while a third group will do light stretching instead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, even after the results of these and other forthcoming trials are in, the “right” amount of exercise for a particular person is likely to depend on their individual circumstances. “For someone with diabetes who wants to improve blood-sugar control, even 10 minutes is probably great,” says Barnes. “But for cardiovascular risk or brain health, that may be different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBamman agrees. “There’s not a single organ system in the body that isn’t affected by exercise,” he says. “Part of the reason the effect of exercise is so consistent and so robust is that there isn’t a single molecular pathway — it’s going to be a combination of all these things. So at the end of all these trials, we’re going to look back and list off not just one or two mechanisms, but a number of them. It’s going to be a complicated answer in the end.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\",\"field_all_authors\":\"  \u003cp class=\\\"article-byline\\\"\u003e\\n        \\n    \\n      \u003cspan class=\\\"author-byline\\\"\u003e\\n        By\\n\\n        \\n          Bob Holmes\\n        \\n      \u003c/span\u003e\\n    \\n  \\n        12.18.2019\\n      \u003c/p\u003e\\n\",\"field_ar_article\":{\"arguments\":[]},\"field_author_bios\":\"  \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBob Holmes\u003c/b\u003e is a science writer based in Edmonton, Canada.\u003c/p\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n\",\"field_banner_alt\":\"Illustration shows people in exercise gear and gloves beating on punching bags, the bags are actually large prescription bottles of pills, representing the idea of exercise as a treatment tool.\",\"field_banner_title\":\"Exercise as medicine\",\"field_caption\":\"  \u003cp\u003eThe benefits of regular exercise turn out to be much greater than indicated by its effect on single standard measures, such as blood pressure.

And as scientists understand more precisely which levers exercise pulls to improve our health, clinicians are on the verge of being able to change their practice. The goal is to think of exercise as a medicine — a therapy that they can prescribe in specific doses for specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s like your own personal regenerative medicine,” says Joyner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrain gains\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists have long known that some of the benefits of exercise are a simple matter of plumbing. Exercise makes blood vessels bigger and keeps them functioning smoothly, which makes them less likely to plug up and cause a heart attack or stroke. There have been hints that this may also mean more blood flow to the brain, which could help prevent cognitive decline. For example, studies have linked exercise to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow researchers are making a more explicit connection between exercise and brain health. They are discovering that the full benefit of exercise comes not from mere physical movement but from actual physical fitness, the body’s cardiovascular health.

That benefits health in a number of ways, from minimizing the risk of diabetes to enhancing the body’s immune response to ills such as cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuscle is the largest consumer of all the glucose that floods into the bloodstream after a meal. More muscle means quicker removal of this glucose surge, says Bamman — and therefore, less exposure to the harm caused by elevated blood sugar, a serious health issue for people prone to diabetes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe muscle-building aspects of exercise also help reverse a key change associated with aging: a decline in the function of mitochondria, our cells’ energy generators. This decline, often seen in sedentary individuals, can leave the mitochondria unable to completely burn the cellular fuel and that can lead cells to generate more oxidants, the oxygen-rich, reactive molecules that damage proteins and DNA. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuscles are chock-full of mitochondria and exercise can help avoid this oxidative damage. Nair’s studies show that aerobic exercise, alone or in combination with strength training, \u003ca href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/100/4/1654/2815140\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eimproves people’s mitochondrial function\u003c/a\u003e, reduces the production of oxidants and forestalls oxidative damage.

Usually, when other organ systems need amino acids, says Bamman, “those are drawn from muscle.” That’s especially important when someone is sick because the immune system needs lots of amino acids to make antibodies that fight infection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest benefit from building muscle, though, may come from the signaling molecules it pumps into the blood. Bente Klarlund Pedersen, an exercise physiologist at the University of Copenhagen, identified the most-studied of these signaling molecules back in 2000, and later coined a term for them: myokines. Since then, she and other researchers have found hundreds more, many of which are activated by exercise. These molecules, which are released in response to muscular exertion, help regulate muscle growth, nutrient metabolism, inflammation and a host of other processes. “I think for most people it’s difficult to understand why muscle work can influence my liver or be good for my brain or bones,” she says. Myokines serve as the link between muscle activity and these other organs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important myokines in this crosstalk is interleukin-6. Released in response to muscular exertion, IL-6 has several effects, including \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0174-x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esuppressing hunger\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30567-3\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eenhancing the immune system’s response to cancer\u003c/a\u003e.

One reason abdominal fat is so bad for you is its partnership with inflammation. “If we take out visceral fat and study it in the lab, we see that visceral fat is more inflamed than subcutaneous fat,” says Pedersen. “This inflammation will spill over into the blood, causing chronic systemic inflammation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChronic inflammation, Pedersen suggests in the 2019 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Physiology\u003c/em\u003e, may be the underlying reason \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-physiol-020518-114339\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewhy inactivity contributes to so many different diseases\u003c/a\u003e. “We know that being physically inactive increases the risk of approximately 35 different diseases or disorders,” she says. “And if you have one of these diseases — let’s say you have type 2 diabetes — you have increased risk of others, like cancer or heart disease. If we tie it all together, one feature of all these diseases is physical inactivity, and the other is chronic inflammation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout a decade ago, Pedersen conducted an experiment in which she had healthy young men reduce their daily step count from about 10,000 steps per day to just 1,500. Within two weeks, the men showed a \u003ca href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/181635\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e7 percent increase in abdominal fat mass\u003c/a\u003e. Along with this change, the men showed hints of reduced insulin sensitivity, a change also seen in type 2 diabetes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterleukin-6 appears to be at the heart of exercise’s effect on visceral fat and inflammation. In a recent experiment, Pedersen and her colleagues put 27 potbellied volunteers on a 12-week exercise-bike program, while 26 other volunteers remained inactive. Half the participants in each group also received a drug that blocks the action of IL-6. At the end of the 12 weeks, the exercisers had lost abdominal fat, as expected — but \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(18)30744-7\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eonly if they had not received the IL-6 blocker\u003c/a\u003e. (Oddly, IL-6 is generally thought of as a pro-inflammatory molecule, because it is more abundant in obese people with systemic inflammation.

Several studies already point in this direction. For example, more than half of 64 adults with type 2 diabetes were able to \u003ca href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2648632\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003estop taking medication to lower their blood sugar\u003c/a\u003e within a year of beginning a regular exercise program, Pedersen and her team found. And a survey of more than 300 randomized controlled trials found that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5577\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eexercise was just as effective as drugs \u003c/a\u003efor people at risk of heart disease and diabetes, and was more effective than drugs for rehab after a stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if exercise is to truly become a medicine like any other, clinicians will need to learn how much to prescribe to maximize its benefits. “Just saying ‘be physically active’ is like telling people ‘eat better’ — it doesn’t tell us what we should be doing,” says Kirk Erickson, an exercise psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh. But developing more precise dosing recommendations is difficult, because there are so many ways to exercise, which vary in duration, intensity, frequency and kind. (Tailoring to individual disease risks — telling one person to do \u003cem\u003eX\u003c/em\u003e  because they’re at risk of diabetes, and another person to do \u003cem\u003eY\u003c/em\u003e  because of a family history of dementia — is an even more distant goal.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearchers are still working out what matters in this complex arena. Exercises that involve more muscle groups generate more IL-6, so full-body exercises like running have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than exercises that target just a few muscle groups, says Pedersen. And the benefits go away within a couple of days, suggesting that exercising frequently is important. “If it’s been 48 hours since you exercised, it’s time to do it again,” says Jill Barnes, an exercise physiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of upcoming randomized trials may soon bring more certainty to the dosing question. One of the largest, which Bamman is involved with at the University of Alabama, will have nearly 2,000 volunteers undertaking either 12 weeks of endurance exercise, 12 weeks of weight training or no exercise program. Researchers will measure gene activity, molecular signaling and other changes within the body, which could allow them to \u003ca href=\\\"https://motrpac.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003epin down exactly how these two modes of exercise differ \u003c/a\u003ein effect.

Researchers will measure inflammation, signaling molecules, body composition and other markers, as well as mental acuity, on more than 600 volunteers ages 65 to 80, both before and after a year of exercise. Some of the volunteers will do 150 minutes per week of supervised moderate exercise, others will do 225 minutes per week, while a third group will do light stretching instead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, even after the results of these and other forthcoming trials are in, the “right” amount of exercise for a particular person is likely to depend on their individual circumstances. “For someone with diabetes who wants to improve blood-sugar control, even 10 minutes is probably great,” says Barnes. “But for cardiovascular risk or brain health, that may be different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBamman agrees. “There’s not a single organ system in the body that isn’t affected by exercise,” he says. “Part of the reason the effect of exercise is so consistent and so robust is that there isn’t a single molecular pathway — it’s going to be a combination of all these things. So at the end of all these trials, we’re going to look back and list off not just one or two mechanisms, but a number of them.

And in an area of research where size is crucial, such studies count their volunteers not by the hundred or the thousand, but by the hundred thousand.

Medicine traditionally is guided by a patient’s physical symptoms and measurable changes to physiology — what biologists call the phenotype. Integrating genetic data — a patient’s genotype — into these deliberations could help tailor treatments to boost their effectiveness, or even identify people at higher risk of developing a given disease, who could be offered help earlier. But to make that work, scientists need to connect the dots: match genotype to phenotype, find patterns and connections in the way people’s DNA varies and the way their health does, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThose connections are becoming clearer. In February this year, for example, scientists found genetic markers in the biobank data that \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25431\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003elinked high cholesterol to the development of motor neuron disease\u003c/a\u003e. Cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, the results suggest, might prevent this deadly and incurable condition. Last month, a different team combed through the genetics of 334,000 of the half-million people signed up to the biobank project to identify genes associated with problematic metabolism of uric acid, which causes health problems including the painful condition gout. From head to toe, month by month scientists are using the biobank information to reveal everything from the benefits of being left-handed to the genetic basis for hearing loss and the damage that diabetes can do to the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK project isn’t the first to recruit volunteers to identify links between genes and disease. National efforts are also under way in Estonia, Sweden, Iceland, China and Mexico. And back in the 1990s, the Icelandic company \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.decode.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003edeCODE\u003c/a\u003e set out to build a database of the genes they found in the country’s population.

The British effort can call on data from some 500,000 recruits — but, as it often does, the US military has gone further. In April, the US \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eMillion Veterans Program\u003c/a\u003e signed up its 750,000th participant since it began in 2011, and still wants more to reach its eponymous goal.

Access. Other biobanks set up around the world are useful projects that can help answer some specific questions, Denny says. But it’s often difficult for outside scientists to get access to the data. Some national projects guard their secrets from foreign eyes as a way to give their own researchers a head start.

It focused on individuals ages 40 to 69 because organizers figured it would be most useful to study older people, who tend to more quickly show the signs of ill health that researchers are interested in. (Indeed, the carefully preserved samples at the Manchester HQ now represent the earthly remains of at least 20,000 volunteers who have since passed away.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eParticipants weren’t paid and had to spend hours at one of several regional centers, where they surrendered blood and urine, had their health examined and filled in surveys on their habits and lifestyle. As a result, the biobank population is not as diverse as geneticists might like, Collins admits, especially if the results are supposed to be useful around the world. Some 94 percent of people the biobank signed up are white, and certain socioeconomic groups, including young, low-income white men, are underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the blood samples were analyzed for simple variations in genetic sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. These single base-pair changes in DNA occur at specific places in the genome and can explain traits such as eye color and inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia. They also act as markers to indicate risk of complex diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer’s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-center\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"A graphic shows a timeline of UK Biobank developments from its establishment in 2003 up to 2019, when the 10,000th researcher registered to work with the data.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/376/G-biobank-timeline.svg\\\" title=\\\"UK Biobank timeline\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of these genotyping data were made available for a group of 150,000 biobank participants in May 2015. Results from the other 350,000 people were added two years later. That fulfilled the original plan, but as genetic sequencing has become faster and cheaper, other researchers wanted to go further — some of them in private companies. In 2017, the drug firms GSK and Regeneron offered to sequence the “exome” of 50,000 UK Biobank participants. This gives a readout of the sections of DNA that actually code for proteins, and is seen as a more powerful way to locate useful information that could be used to develop medicines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe companies agreed to pay the bill, but wanted something in return: exclusive access to the data. They were given 6 to 12 months, then earlier this year the information was released to the wider scientific community. A larger group of pharma companies is now working on exome sequences for the remaining 450,000 volunteers under the same arrangement, with the data due to be fully released next year. The total cost of the exome sequencing — paid for by the commercial firms — will be $150 million.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a sensible and pragmatic way for publicly funded science to work with commercial companies, says cognitive epidemiologist \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/simon-cox\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSimon Cox\u003c/a\u003e, who uses UK Biobank data to study cognitive aging at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not necessarily ideal,” he says. “But if this is the model we have to adopt to get this stuff done then I don’t think it’s spectacularly untoward.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCox recently published a study that exploits another extension of the biobank’s original goals. In April 2016, organizers started to invite thousands of the participants back to take detailed MRI scans of their bodies, brains and other organs and add them to the database. Some 40,000 of the original volunteers have been scanned this way so far, and the project wants to make that 100,000 by 2022. Some of these volunteers also agreed to take a battery of psychological tests when they returned — to probe reasoning and intelligence with questions not asked in the original assessment. Cox and his colleagues took advantage of this to revisit one of the most controversial historic questions in psychology: \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/599472v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eDoes a bigger brain make someone smarter?\u003c/a\u003e (Spoiler: It does, but not much.)

At a stroke, Cox says, the biobank’s massive numbers address one of the strongest criticisms of findings based on MRI scans — that they include too few people to give reliable results.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the biggest dataset there is,” says \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-nobis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eLisa Nobis\u003c/a\u003e, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. And it shows the way that science is going. “When MRI first came out, you could get a paper in \u003cem\u003eNature\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eScience\u003c/em\u003e with just 15 people. But in the last few years, studies have shown that less than 50 people is not reliable at all” as a general rule. She is using the biobank scans to build up a picture of how the brain’s \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562678v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ehippocampus shrinks with age\u003c/a\u003e and with dementia. The plan is to produce a reference tool of normal hippocampus size for different age groups that future clinicians can use to spot problems earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the kind of study, Nobis says, that can only be done with a very large sample size. Scientists’ attempts to boost numbers of brains by combining results from sets of smaller MRI studies run into their own set of problems: Technical differences between the way scans are done in different centers often make it difficult to meaningfully compare them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment in MRI scanners and other shiny, new pieces of equipment gives the Manchester headquarters of the biobank the air of a wealthy private hospital. Elderly volunteers are helped along its spotless wide corridors and shuttled among different scanners, depending on the level of tissue detail required. In one room, staff are preparing to take ultrasound scans of the thickness of the wall of a patient’s carotid arteries. Again, it’s a measurement that is being taken because it can be, rather than because there’s a solid scientific or medical need for the data at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientists hope this type of basic anatomical information will be useful one day in the future — especially as the biobank database links to details about hospital admissions, treatments and surgery held in the electronic records of Britain’s National Health Service and aims to expand the links to even more granular clinical information about complaints, symptoms and prescriptions held in primary care health records of thousands of doctors’ offices. According to biobank staff, most volunteers realize that the data gathered from them and others is unlikely to benefit them directly, but they say they hope it will help future generations, either of their own family or someone else’s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne such volunteer is Irene Soulsby, a 61-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne, in northeast England, who is happy to disclose and talk about her involvement.

Soulsby enrolled in 2008 and did so, she says, because she had previously benefited from successful treatment for cancer, which she knew was based on prior medical research. “I’m here because somebody’s done this for me,” she says.

Before it even got off the ground, a 2003 editorial in the leading medical journal the \u003cem\u003eLancet\u003c/em\u003e voiced skepticism. It called the UK Biobank “\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13377-6/fulltext\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea project in search of a protocol\u003c/a\u003e” that many researchers in Britain saw “as an ill-conceived, politically motivated project, in which consultations have only been done to give an appearance of legitimacy and in which the scientific case has not been made for its design.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the apparent success and cranking up of the scientific output — more than 270 research papers appeared in 2018 alone based on UK Biobank data — such criticisms have not gone away entirely. \u003ca href=\\\"https://bio.psu.edu/directory/kmw4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eKenneth Weiss\u003c/a\u003e is an emeritus professor of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State University and a long-standing critic of mega-genomics projects based on the promise of big data. “There is a need for skepticism. There are better ways to find and document the complex causation of genetics than this open-ended genomic approach,” he says. Having swallowed more than $250 million so far, the UK project is certainly an expensive option, and much of the burden is carried by UK taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs with all medical studies, the biobank results are only as strong as the data and assumptions they rest on. And in October, scientists discovered a flaw in a biobank analysis that proved fatal for the high-profile study that was based on it. A technical glitch led to the biobank undercounting how many older people carried a specific mutation in the \u003cem\u003eCCR5\u003c/em\u003e gene that confers resistance to HIV. Researchers used this as evidence in a paper that concluded that carrying this mutation could shorten people’s lives.

When participants sign up for the project, they do so without knowing exactly what will be done with the information they provide. Soulsby says she trusts the project officials to use it properly, but not everybody is happy with the arrangement. Traditionally, scientific research projects ask for explicit consent from volunteers after outlining exactly how the samples or data they provide will be used. The broad spectrum of research that blossoms from a biobank project make this impractical, so a more general type of “open consent” is used instead, under which volunteers essentially give blanket and open-ended approval for their samples to be used however project organizers deem fit, even after their own deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn a critical essay published in 2017 in the journal \u003cem\u003ePLOS Biology\u003c/em\u003e, law and ethics experts Timothy Caulfield and Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta, Canada, \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002654\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eargued that this isn’t good enough\u003c/a\u003e. “There remains a deep lack of clarity around basic legal and ethical principles,” they wrote of UK Biobank and projects like it. “The international research community has built a massive and diverse research infrastructure on a foundation that has the potential, however slight, to collapse, in bits or altogether.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne issue that Caulfield and Murdock highlight is what lawyers call the “rights of control.” It’s possible for example, that participants, or their families, could seek payment for profitable outcomes, or even challenge the use of their data for specific projects they disagree with. And there could be more to disagree with than one might expect. The project was sold as a biomedicine effort — and the terms of the UK Biobank open consent process ask volunteers to agree to vague-sounding “health-related research purposes” — but some of the research does stretch the definition of what many people might think of as medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, for example, an international team of researchers used the biobank data to show how genetic variants associated with lower educational attainment and lower socioeconomic status bunched together in former coal-mining districts of the UK, a report that raised concerns among some in the field. Such analyses are controversial because they attempt to extend the links between genotype and phenotype from medical traits to complex — and contested — social behaviors and values.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1487\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ePeter Visscher\u003c/a\u003e, a geneticist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who worked on the study, says it does have a strong link to health — and that’s why the UK Biobank officials approved it. The genetic patterns on educational attainment that the team analyzed closely associate with risk of conditions like coronary heart disease and schizophrenia, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGenes, lifestyle, environment, health, social values, behavior: Scientists across the world are using the biobank data to help piece together and sort out the complexity of what makes people — of Britain, of Iceland, of the US military, and of the world — tick.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a collaborative effort, and the UK project — and UK science — is playing its part. At a time when political divisions over Brexit have triggered endless debates about Britain’s place in the world, UK scientists are spending UK taxpayers money to send the health and genetic data of UK citizens to all who can use it, whoever and wherever they are, for the common good.

Some worry that the broad nature of the research done with the samples makes it impossible for volunteers to give proper consent. And in October, a high-profile paper was withdrawn because of technical problems in the way biobank data were analyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut to scientists like Denny, the promise is clear. “This is a resource for the world,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eMaking the genetic connection\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe principle behind the UK Biobank is ambitious: to link health outcomes to the genetic data that pour from DNA sequencing machines across the world. Medicine traditionally is guided by a patient’s physical symptoms and measurable changes to physiology — what biologists call the phenotype. Integrating genetic data — a patient’s genotype — into these deliberations could help tailor treatments to boost their effectiveness, or even identify people at higher risk of developing a given disease, who could be offered help earlier. But to make that work, scientists need to connect the dots: match genotype to phenotype, find patterns and connections in the way people’s DNA varies and the way their health does, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThose connections are becoming clearer. In February this year, for example, scientists found genetic markers in the biobank data that \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25431\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003elinked high cholesterol to the development of motor neuron disease\u003c/a\u003e. Cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, the results suggest, might prevent this deadly and incurable condition. Last month, a different team combed through the genetics of 334,000 of the half-million people signed up to the biobank project to identify genes associated with problematic metabolism of uric acid, which causes health problems including the painful condition gout. From head to toe, month by month scientists are using the biobank information to reveal everything from the benefits of being left-handed to the genetic basis for hearing loss and the damage that diabetes can do to the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK project isn’t the first to recruit volunteers to identify links between genes and disease. National efforts are also under way in Estonia, Sweden, Iceland, China and Mexico. And back in the 1990s, the Icelandic company \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.decode.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003edeCODE\u003c/a\u003e set out to build a database of the genes they found in the country’s population. Analysis of the Icelandic data, now owned by the US biopharmaceutical giant Amgen, continues — for example, the company is now working on medicines to mimic the heart-protecting effects of a gene variant carried by one in 120 Icelanders.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEven with its high volunteer numbers, the UK Biobank isn’t the largest project of its type either. The British effort can call on data from some 500,000 recruits — but, as it often does, the US military has gone further. In April, the US \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eMillion Veterans Program\u003c/a\u003e signed up its 750,000th participant since it began in 2011, and still wants more to reach its eponymous goal. The MVP screens the health and genomes of veterans to probe the genetics of post-traumatic stress disorder, diabetes, heart disease, suicide prevention and other topics of particular relevance to that community.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what’s so great about Great Britain’s project? Access. Other biobanks set up around the world are useful projects that can help answer some specific questions, Denny says. But it’s often difficult for outside scientists to get access to the data. Some national projects guard their secrets from foreign eyes as a way to give their own researchers a head start. Others fret about privacy and losing the trust of participants if they were to start sharing their information more widely.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK Biobank is unique because open and free data access for everyone was the plan from day one, says \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/rory-collins\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eRory Collins\u003c/a\u003e, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford and chief executive of the UK Biobank project. “We wanted to build something, a resource, in the same way as they built CERN,” the European particle physics lab near Geneva, he says. “This wasn’t a grant application which has to have a specific hypothesis.” It’s a point that other people attached to the Biobank project make repeatedly: This is a basic science project. If they built it, they thought that scientists would come and want to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThey have come, and continue to do so.

It focused on individuals ages 40 to 69 because organizers figured it would be most useful to study older people, who tend to more quickly show the signs of ill health that researchers are interested in. (Indeed, the carefully preserved samples at the Manchester HQ now represent the earthly remains of at least 20,000 volunteers who have since passed away.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eParticipants weren’t paid and had to spend hours at one of several regional centers, where they surrendered blood and urine, had their health examined and filled in surveys on their habits and lifestyle. As a result, the biobank population is not as diverse as geneticists might like, Collins admits, especially if the results are supposed to be useful around the world. Some 94 percent of people the biobank signed up are white, and certain socioeconomic groups, including young, low-income white men, are underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the blood samples were analyzed for simple variations in genetic sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. These single base-pair changes in DNA occur at specific places in the genome and can explain traits such as eye color and inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia. They also act as markers to indicate risk of complex diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer’s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of these genotyping data were made available for a group of 150,000 biobank participants in May 2015. Results from the other 350,000 people were added two years later. That fulfilled the original plan, but as genetic sequencing has become faster and cheaper, other researchers wanted to go further — some of them in private companies. In 2017, the drug firms GSK and Regeneron offered to sequence the “exome” of 50,000 UK Biobank participants. This gives a readout of the sections of DNA that actually code for proteins, and is seen as a more powerful way to locate useful information that could be used to develop medicines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe companies agreed to pay the bill, but wanted something in return: exclusive access to the data. They were given 6 to 12 months, then earlier this year the information was released to the wider scientific community. A larger group of pharma companies is now working on exome sequences for the remaining 450,000 volunteers under the same arrangement, with the data due to be fully released next year. The total cost of the exome sequencing — paid for by the commercial firms — will be $150 million.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a sensible and pragmatic way for publicly funded science to work with commercial companies, says cognitive epidemiologist \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/simon-cox\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSimon Cox\u003c/a\u003e, who uses UK Biobank data to study cognitive aging at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not necessarily ideal,” he says. “But if this is the model we have to adopt to get this stuff done then I don’t think it’s spectacularly untoward.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCox recently published a study that exploits another extension of the biobank’s original goals. In April 2016, organizers started to invite thousands of the participants back to take detailed MRI scans of their bodies, brains and other organs and add them to the database. Some 40,000 of the original volunteers have been scanned this way so far, and the project wants to make that 100,000 by 2022. Some of these volunteers also agreed to take a battery of psychological tests when they returned — to probe reasoning and intelligence with questions not asked in the original assessment. Cox and his colleagues took advantage of this to revisit one of the most controversial historic questions in psychology: \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/599472v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eDoes a bigger brain make someone smarter?\u003c/a\u003e (Spoiler: It does, but not much.) Particularly important, the research showed, is the structure of white matter and the relative size of individual regions such as parts of the frontal cortex.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTo do this analysis, the scientists compared the test scores and brain volumes of more than 18,000 people — way more than had ever been gathered for such a study before. At a stroke, Cox says, the biobank’s massive numbers address one of the strongest criticisms of findings based on MRI scans — that they include too few people to give reliable results.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the biggest dataset there is,” says \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-nobis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eLisa Nobis\u003c/a\u003e, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. And it shows the way that science is going. “When MRI first came out, you could get a paper in \u003cem\u003eNature\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eScience\u003c/em\u003e with just 15 people. But in the last few years, studies have shown that less than 50 people is not reliable at all” as a general rule. She is using the biobank scans to build up a picture of how the brain’s \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562678v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehippocampus shrinks with age\u003c/a\u003e and with dementia. The plan is to produce a reference tool of normal hippocampus size for different age groups that future clinicians can use to spot problems earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the kind of study, Nobis says, that can only be done with a very large sample size. Scientists’ attempts to boost numbers of brains by combining results from sets of smaller MRI studies run into their own set of problems: Technical differences between the way scans are done in different centers often make it difficult to meaningfully compare them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment in MRI scanners and other shiny, new pieces of equipment gives the Manchester headquarters of the biobank the air of a wealthy private hospital. Elderly volunteers are helped along its spotless wide corridors and shuttled among different scanners, depending on the level of tissue detail required. In one room, staff are preparing to take ultrasound scans of the thickness of the wall of a patient’s carotid arteries. Again, it’s a measurement that is being taken because it can be, rather than because there’s a solid scientific or medical need for the data at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientists hope this type of basic anatomical information will be useful one day in the future — especially as the biobank database links to details about hospital admissions, treatments and surgery held in the electronic records of Britain’s National Health Service and aims to expand the links to even more granular clinical information about complaints, symptoms and prescriptions held in primary care health records of thousands of doctors’ offices. According to biobank staff, most volunteers realize that the data gathered from them and others is unlikely to benefit them directly, but they say they hope it will help future generations, either of their own family or someone else’s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne such volunteer is Irene Soulsby, a 61-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne, in northeast England, who is happy to disclose and talk about her involvement. (The biobank promises confidentiality, if preferred.) Soulsby enrolled in 2008 and did so, she says, because she had previously benefited from successful treatment for cancer, which she knew was based on prior medical research. “I’m here because somebody’s done this for me,” she says. There is another motive too: Given her history, she welcomes the extra tests and ongoing scrutiny of her health. “It’s an amazing resource and I’m really proud to be part of it,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom the start, some skepticism\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe broad scope of the project was not always viewed as an asset. Before it even got off the ground, a 2003 editorial in the leading medical journal the \u003cem\u003eLancet\u003c/em\u003e voiced skepticism. It called the UK Biobank “\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13377-6/fulltext\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea project in search of a protocol\u003c/a\u003e” that many researchers in Britain saw “as an ill-conceived, politically motivated project, in which consultations have only been done to give an appearance of legitimacy and in which the scientific case has not been made for its design.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the apparent success and cranking up of the scientific output — more than 270 research papers appeared in 2018 alone based on UK Biobank data — such criticisms have not gone away entirely. \u003ca href=\\\"https://bio.psu.edu/directory/kmw4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eKenneth Weiss\u003c/a\u003e is an emeritus professor of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State University and a long-standing critic of mega-genomics projects based on the promise of big data. “There is a need for skepticism. There are better ways to find and document the complex causation of genetics than this open-ended genomic approach,” he says. Having swallowed more than $250 million so far, the UK project is certainly an expensive option, and much of the burden is carried by UK taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs with all medical studies, the biobank results are only as strong as the data and assumptions they rest on. And in October, scientists discovered a flaw in a biobank analysis that proved fatal for the high-profile study that was based on it. A technical glitch led to the biobank undercounting how many older people carried a specific mutation in the \u003cem\u003eCCR5\u003c/em\u003e gene that confers resistance to HIV. Researchers used this as evidence in a paper that concluded that carrying this mutation could shorten people’s lives. The finding was significant because this is the genetic change the Chinese scientist \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eHe Jiankui\u003c/a\u003e claimed to have deliberately introduced to twin baby girls in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper was retracted, but genetic experts who reanalyzed the data said the problem was a one-off that doesn’t undermine other studies using biobank data.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also concerns about ethics and consent. When participants sign up for the project, they do so without knowing exactly what will be done with the information they provide. Soulsby says she trusts the project officials to use it properly, but not everybody is happy with the arrangement. Traditionally, scientific research projects ask for explicit consent from volunteers after outlining exactly how the samples or data they provide will be used. The broad spectrum of research that blossoms from a biobank project make this impractical, so a more general type of “open consent” is used instead, under which volunteers essentially give blanket and open-ended approval for their samples to be used however project organizers deem fit, even after their own deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn a critical essay published in 2017 in the journal \u003cem\u003ePLOS Biology\u003c/em\u003e, law and ethics experts Timothy Caulfield and Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta, Canada, \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002654\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eargued that this isn’t good enough\u003c/a\u003e. “There remains a deep lack of clarity around basic legal and ethical principles,” they wrote of UK Biobank and projects like it. “The international research community has built a massive and diverse research infrastructure on a foundation that has the potential, however slight, to collapse, in bits or altogether.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne issue that Caulfield and Murdock highlight is what lawyers call the “rights of control.” It’s possible for example, that participants, or their families, could seek payment for profitable outcomes, or even challenge the use of their data for specific projects they disagree with. And there could be more to disagree with than one might expect. The project was sold as a biomedicine effort — and the terms of the UK Biobank open consent process ask volunteers to agree to vague-sounding “health-related research purposes” — but some of the research does stretch the definition of what many people might think of as medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, for example, an international team of researchers used the biobank data to show how genetic variants associated with lower educational attainment and lower socioeconomic status bunched together in former coal-mining districts of the UK, a report that raised concerns among some in the field. Such analyses are controversial because they attempt to extend the links between genotype and phenotype from medical traits to complex — and contested — social behaviors and values.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1487\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ePeter Visscher\u003c/a\u003e, a geneticist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who worked on the study, says it does have a strong link to health — and that’s why the UK Biobank officials approved it. The genetic patterns on educational attainment that the team analyzed closely associate with risk of conditions like coronary heart disease and schizophrenia, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGenes, lifestyle, environment, health, social values, behavior: Scientists across the world are using the biobank data to help piece together and sort out the complexity of what makes people — of Britain, of Iceland, of the US military, and of the world — tick.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a collaborative effort, and the UK project — and UK science — is playing its part.

Dueling males shove and tap on each other’s single, enlarged claw — and, should the fight escalate, they lock claws, secret-handshake style, as if they’re testing the other’s strength.

And three: Males of the species compete in one-on-one duels.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fighting is almost never to the death and rarely results in serious wounds. Scientists say that this supports the idea that these weapons are built for rivalry — their designs optimized not for destruction but for power struggles. Indeed, variation in the size of male weaponry is huge, Emlen notes: While overall body size among adult male elk might vary by a factor of 2 at most, their antler racks can vary by a factor of more than 30, he says. And the most dazzling weapons act largely as deterrents, with actual fights breaking out only when males are closely matched.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eWeapons for show\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs the weapons grow bigger and flashier, they come with the cost of producing and lugging around such big structures. (And sometimes other costs: Male fiddler crabs can only stuff algae in their mouths with one claw.) Studies show that the weapons’ sizes are sensitive to nutrition, parasite load, stress and overall physical condition — and so the healthiest, most fit individuals sport the most impressive weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers consider these ostentatious male weapons to be honest signals — \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jez.1961\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eadvertising the owner’s might\u003c/a\u003e and fitness accurately.

Some will cruise an area of multiple male burrows and size up the weapons being waved at them, among other things, before selecting a mate. “We don’t know what the female’s thinking, but she’s taking into account a bunch of complicated information,” Swanson says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThough scientists believe that the primary role for these animal weapons is in reproduction, there are cases in which the weapons also serve as deterrents or defenses against predators — likely as an evolutionary bonus. Elk antlers are a case in point. Unlike many other North American species in the deer family, elk hang onto their antlers until March, long after the mating season has ended in October. When Matt Metz, a PhD student at the University of Montana, and his colleagues tracked wolf kills in Yellowstone National Park they found that during March, \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0657-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ewolves are three to four times more likely to attack an antlerless male elk\u003c/a\u003e than one still wearing his rack.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSince elk rarely use the antlers in defense, preferring to rear up and kick predators with their front hooves, presumably the structures serve as deterrents, Metz says. Yet if antler weapons had evolved primarily as a defense against predators, it wouldn’t make sense to shed them at all, he adds — and females should have them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbellishments and frills\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy nature came up with such a bizarre array of weapon shapes and forms remains a bit of a mystery. But as a general rule, Swanson says, evolution tended to exaggerate structures already in existence. Crabs and lobsters have pincer claws that over evolutionary time became enlarged. And arthropods (spiders, insects and crustaceans) have exoskeletons that genetic changes could sculpt to form projections such as the horns or giant mandibles seen in beetles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWeapons also are probably molded by the type of fighting and where it’s done — as borne out by work on the shapes of rhinoceros beetle horns by evolutionary biologist Erin McCullough. As a graduate student with Emlen, she spent two summers in Taiwan videotaping battles of the Japanese horned beetle, which has a pitchfork-shaped horn. She compared its fights to those of the Hercules beetle, which sports thick, pinching horns, and a species of Golofa beetle, which has thinner, sword-like horns. Each fights in slightly different ways, all with the goal of flicking their opponent off a tree branch or bamboo shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video -full-width\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"video-container\\\"\u003e\u003ciframe allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2I2yc_OeoU\\\" width=\\\"560\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video-caption\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Hercules beetles (\u003cem\u003eDynastes hercules\u003c/em\u003e) battle it out.

An example is seen in the horns and frills of the triceratops, a type of ceratopsid dinosaur — big-bodied herbivores that lived in large herds in open spaces, not unlike caribou. “They had the biggest skulls of land-living animals that ever lived, partly due to these big bony structures on their heads,” says Scott Sampson, paleontologist and executive director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s tricky to study dinosaur behavior, or even determine a skeleton’s sex, from fossils. Paleontologists continue to debate whether such unusual face decor was used to help dinosaur species recognize their own kind, for male-male mating contests or signals to females, or for defense. But Sampson says several lines of evidence persuade him that these horns were sexual weapons or displays rather than spears to fend off predators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, these features weren’t fully grown until the animals reached adult size and reproductive age. And many of the features of dinosaur horns, spikes and frills were “lousy” as weapons against carnivorous predators, Sampson says. Some were thin to the point of fragility or curved in seemingly the wrong direction.

From that and other evidence, many biologists think that bigger weapons can advertise reproductive superiority, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while Emlen believes that male weapons evolved primarily for the purposes of male-male rivalry battles, comparative physiologist Brook Swanson of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, argues that those signals are almost certainly also being assessed by females choosing mates. “Even if a male could beat up all the other males, females almost always have a choice among mates,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTake those fiddler crabs. Males of more than 100 species of the crabs have enlarged claws, \u003ca href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/65/1/83/5050399\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eand research suggests that the females can be picky\u003c/a\u003e. Some will cruise an area of multiple male burrows and size up the weapons being waved at them, among other things, before selecting a mate. “We don’t know what the female’s thinking, but she’s taking into account a bunch of complicated information,” Swanson says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThough scientists believe that the primary role for these animal weapons is in reproduction, there are cases in which the weapons also serve as deterrents or defenses against predators — likely as an evolutionary bonus. Elk antlers are a case in point. Unlike many other North American species in the deer family, elk hang onto their antlers until March, long after the mating season has ended in October. When Matt Metz, a PhD student at the University of Montana, and his colleagues tracked wolf kills in Yellowstone National Park they found that during March, \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0657-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewolves are three to four times more likely to attack an antlerless male elk\u003c/a\u003e than one still wearing his rack.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSince elk rarely use the antlers in defense, preferring to rear up and kick predators with their front hooves, presumably the structures serve as deterrents, Metz says. Yet if antler weapons had evolved primarily as a defense against predators, it wouldn’t make sense to shed them at all, he adds — and females should have them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbellishments and frills\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy nature came up with such a bizarre array of weapon shapes and forms remains a bit of a mystery. But as a general rule, Swanson says, evolution tended to exaggerate structures already in existence. Crabs and lobsters have pincer claws that over evolutionary time became enlarged. And arthropods (spiders, insects and crustaceans) have exoskeletons that genetic changes could sculpt to form projections such as the horns or giant mandibles seen in beetles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWeapons also are probably molded by the type of fighting and where it’s done — as borne out by work on the shapes of rhinoceros beetle horns by evolutionary biologist Erin McCullough. As a graduate student with Emlen, she spent two summers in Taiwan videotaping battles of the Japanese horned beetle, which has a pitchfork-shaped horn. She compared its fights to those of the Hercules beetle, which sports thick, pinching horns, and a species of Golofa beetle, which has thinner, sword-like horns. Each fights in slightly different ways, all with the goal of flicking their opponent off a tree branch or bamboo shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMcCullough, now a postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University in New York, first measured how much force was needed to dislodge an average-size male from a branch. Next, she CT-scanned the critters’ horns, built 3-D computer models of the structures and used engineering tools to calculate the stresses and strains that the structures could withstand. She found that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14484\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eeach horn performed best under the forces of its species-specific fighting style\u003c/a\u003e. “This is a big component for why different species have different weapons,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn October, an international group of researchers used the same computer modeling techniques to suggest \u003ca href=\\\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2019.1873\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethat the largest antlers ever to exist\u003c/a\u003e — the 12-feet-across by 5-feet-high rack of the prehistoric Irish elk — \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/giant-antlers-deer.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewere used for male sparring, too\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut McCullough notes that the scariest, showiest weapons are not always very lethal. Some diversity, such as curlicues and extra tines, is probably driven by the display functions of weapons, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eHorn-y dinosaur courtship\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the largest animal weapons ever found adorned dinosaur heads. An example is seen in the horns and frills of the triceratops, a type of ceratopsid dinosaur — big-bodied herbivores that lived in large herds in open spaces, not unlike caribou. “They had the biggest skulls of land-living animals that ever lived, partly due to these big bony structures on their heads,” says Scott Sampson, paleontologist and executive director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s tricky to study dinosaur behavior, or even determine a skeleton’s sex, from fossils. Paleontologists continue to debate whether such unusual face decor was used to help dinosaur species recognize their own kind, for male-male mating contests or signals to females, or for defense. But Sampson says several lines of evidence persuade him that these horns were sexual weapons or displays rather than spears to fend off predators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, these features weren’t fully grown until the animals reached adult size and reproductive age. And many of the features of dinosaur horns, spikes and frills were “lousy” as weapons against carnivorous predators, Sampson says. Some were thin to the point of fragility or curved in seemingly the wrong direction. Take, for example, \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.eartharchives.org/articles/weird-fossil-of-the-week-kosmoceratops/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eKosmoceratops\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a flamboyant fossil \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012292\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003efound in southern Utah\u003c/a\u003e that sported 15 horns on its face, the top of its skull and its bony frill, some of which curve back on themselves. “I’m quite certain this pattern is all about show,” Sampson says. Ceratopsids, he says, would have been more likely to use their sheer size as a weapon against predators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n--\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFrom spines and plates on late Cretaceous behemoths to horns on tiny, modern-day beetles, making and carrying flashy weapons can come at a huge energy cost. An elk’s antlers are akin to a 180-pound man wearing a 12-pound gold chain around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the costs are worth it. “In a lot of mating systems, if you don’t produce a weapon, then you have zero success,” Swanson says. “You have no choice but to play the game.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-120519-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKendall Powell\u003c/b\u003e writes about science from her home office in Lafayette, Colorado, a state full of weapon-wielding elk, moose, bighorn sheep and triceratops fossils.

She and her colleagues collected 68 samples of tiger dung from Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park in the south of India, preserving them in alcohol. Back in the lab, they isolated the DNA inside to examine the genetic sequences — the strings of letters A, C, G and T — of certain parts of the tiger genome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf a genome is like a book, most of the words will be identical from tiger to tiger. What geneticists look for are the places where the words can differ. Specifically, Ramakrishnan and colleagues analyzed places where the tiger genome repeats itself, and stutters — say, GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA. No two tigers have the same number of repeats at each spot, so scientists can use the differing counts to distinguish individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe researchers got high-quality data from 38 of their scat samples, and together these represented 26 individuals.

Based on their tiger family tree, Luo’s group predicts that between 1 million and 110,000 years ago, tiger populations contracted into a small group, located in modern-day China and Southeast Asia.

They developed genes best suited to their lifestyles in locales ranging from the tropics to the tundra.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Sumatran tigers are smaller than others. They range from 165 to 308 pounds, compared to about 550 for Bengals, the biggest subspecies. Miniaturization is a common island adaptation for large animals, says Yue-Chen Liu, a geneticist who recently earned a PhD in Luo’s lab and plans to start work at Harvard University soon. Tigers may have encountered smaller prey when they reached the island of Sumatra, and through evolution, shrank to match.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSize is controlled by many genes, so Liu was surprised to find one in particular that might control Sumatran tigers’ size.

Most phytoplankton rely on high levels of nutrients such as nitrate to survive, but coccolithophores can tolerate comparatively lower concentrations.

The most extensive bloom in the world covers the entire Southern Ocean around Antarctica, about 16 percent of the entire global ocean when at its peak between the astral spring and fall. Balch and colleagues dubbed this the Great Calcite Belt when they discovered it on a series of cruises in 2011 and 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCoccolithophores currently stand as one of the most abundant and environmentally influential groups of phytoplankton in the world — in fact, scientists think they are the largest contributors of limestone in the entire ocean. But their prevalence could waver as the ocean acidifies with climate change, says Marius Müller, an oceanographer at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil who studies coccolithophore calcification. In acidic waters, he explains, coccolithophores will need to work harder to modify the chemistry of the seawater inside their cell to form calcite. And that extra energetic cost comes at the expense of other important tasks, such as growing and reproducing. This could allow non-shell-forming organisms to outcompete coccolithophores and other life forms struggling to build shells, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, a 2015 study based on satellite imagery of the \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062769\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSouthern Ocean\u003c/a\u003e did find that coccolithophore shell production in the Great Calcite Belt may have decreased during the study period between 1998 and 2014, potentially due to acidification. Still, researchers have conflicting findings on how different species of coccolithophores in different places respond to ocean acidification. In one case, a study Balch coauthored in 2015 indicated that the \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6267/1533\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eNorth Atlantic population grew\u003c/a\u003e by nearly 20 percent from 1965 to 2010. The researchers hypothesize that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over that time actually fertilized phytoplankton growth by promoting photosynthesis, and the benefits of that outweighed the effects of acidification in this location.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLaura Bretherton, an oceanographer at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, Canada, says that this variability in response to acidification can also arise because other factors also influence growth — including ocean temperature, \u003ca href=\\\"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.11115\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eday length at different latitudes\u003c/a\u003e, and nutrient availability. “It goes to show how complex marine environments are,” she says. “It’s not going to be uniform.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding these complicated interactions will be critical in projecting broader changes in the planet’s future climate. But Müller and Balch say that the high environmental stakes aren’t the only things that draw them to this research. So does the striking beauty of coccoliths.

He and colleagues at the nearby Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences arranged a research cruise to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOcean waters in this part of the temperate Atlantic typically run a deep sapphire hue. But this patch was much lighter, more typical of a tropical isle. “We got out in the middle of this thing and the water was basically turquoise in color from horizon to horizon,” Balch says. “You would have thought we had run aground in Bimini.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright patch returned the next summer — a strikingly large, turquoise swirl spread across roughly 100,000 square kilometers. Water samples confirmed Balch’s suspicions of what had caused the bright patches: trillions of coccolithophores, tiny single-celled algae that sport reflective limestone plates made of the mineral calcite, as shown in the false-colored scanning electron micrograph above.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThose two blooms launched \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/wbalch.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eBalch, who still works at the Bigelow lab\u003c/a\u003e, on a career devoted to learning more about coccolithophores, one of the most abundant groups of phytoplankton in the world. As satellite imagery improved, researchers have identified and studied the blooms in ever more detail. And they have tracked several important ways the tiny organisms alter ocean chemistry, including the ability of the ocean to store carbon dioxide and thus keep it out of the atmosphere. So while each individual cell is no wider than a human hair, the sheer magnitude of these blooms gives coccolithophores an outsized impact on ocean chemistry and, in turn, global climate.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut as climate change makes the ocean \u003ca href=\\\"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2009.54.6.1855\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003emore acidic and corrosive\u003c/a\u003e to limestone, some regions will become less hospitable to shell-forming organisms.

Since \u003ca href=\\\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marinesnow.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003edecomposition produces carbon dioxide\u003c/a\u003e, shuttling this material down to the deep reduces carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere and works against climate warming in yet another way.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn his office with a view of the Gulf of Maine, Balch shows a time-lapse video of one of these plates developing within a coccolithophore cell. Once fully formed, the disc is booted out to the cell’s exterior, and the alga continues building more. “Each of these coccoliths takes about two hours to make,” says Balch, grinning at the screen with an enthusiasm undulled by decades of painstaking study of these organisms.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCoccolithophores live in the ocean year-round, but their impressive blooms tend to explode around the summer solstice. “They are always there lurking in the background,” Balch says, “and it’s party time in the summer.” That’s mostly because nutrient levels at the surface of the ocean tend to decline around this time of year. Most phytoplankton rely on high levels of nutrients such as nitrate to survive, but coccolithophores can tolerate comparatively lower concentrations. So they take advantage of the early summer nutrient depletion to outcompete other plankton.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThese seasonal blooms can span distances even more impressive than \u003ca href=\\\"http://grampus.umeoce.maine.edu/dave/Townsend%20et%20al-1994-Coccolithophores.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethose in the Gulf of Maine\u003c/a\u003e, including one recurring bloom that has reached roughly half a million square kilometers across the North Atlantic Basin. The most extensive bloom in the world covers the entire Southern Ocean around Antarctica, about 16 percent of the entire global ocean when at its peak between the astral spring and fall. Balch and colleagues dubbed this the Great Calcite Belt when they discovered it on a series of cruises in 2011 and 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eCoccolithophores currently stand as one of the most abundant and environmentally influential groups of phytoplankton in the world — in fact, scientists think they are the largest contributors of limestone in the entire ocean. But their prevalence could waver as the ocean acidifies with climate change, says Marius Müller, an oceanographer at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil who studies coccolithophore calcification. In acidic waters, he explains, coccolithophores will need to work harder to modify the chemistry of the seawater inside their cell to form calcite. And that extra energetic cost comes at the expense of other important tasks, such as growing and reproducing. This could allow non-shell-forming organisms to outcompete coccolithophores and other life forms struggling to build shells, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, a 2015 study based on satellite imagery of the \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062769\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSouthern Ocean\u003c/a\u003e did find that coccolithophore shell production in the Great Calcite Belt may have decreased during the study period between 1998 and 2014, potentially due to acidification. Still, researchers have conflicting findings on how different species of coccolithophores in different places respond to ocean acidification. In one case, a study Balch coauthored in 2015 indicated that the \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6267/1533\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eNorth Atlantic population grew\u003c/a\u003e by nearly 20 percent from 1965 to 2010. The researchers hypothesize that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over that time actually fertilized phytoplankton growth by promoting photosynthesis, and the benefits of that outweighed the effects of acidification in this location.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLaura Bretherton, an oceanographer at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, Canada, says that this variability in response to acidification can also arise because other factors also influence growth — including ocean temperature, \u003ca href=\\\"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.11115\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eday length at different latitudes\u003c/a\u003e, and nutrient availability. “It goes to show how complex marine environments are,” she says. “It’s not going to be uniform.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding these complicated interactions will be critical in projecting broader changes in the planet’s future climate. But Müller and Balch say that the high environmental stakes aren’t the only things that draw them to this research. So does the striking beauty of coccoliths. The purpose of these ornate plates remains somewhat enigmatic, but theories suggest that they may help prevent viruses from infecting the cells or offer protection from tiny marine animals such as copepods that might like to eat them. “What better way,” Balch says, “to avoid being eaten by a voracious copepod than to cover yourself with rocks?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eDespite their ubiquity and importance in the ocean, coccolithophores remain relatively unfamiliar to the general public.

The cell forms as warm, moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then, as it cools and dries, much of it sinks down toward Earth at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. Lower in the atmosphere, this air moves back toward the equator, completing the cell. Some of this downward-moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator, and is deflected by Earth’s rotation, creating the westerlies. Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole, the bigger the size of the cell, the more the winds move toward the pole.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eData collected by weather balloons, satellites and other means going back to 1960 show that \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JD008861\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eEarth’s tropical belt has widened\u003c/a\u003e in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude, effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells.

With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed, much like an ice skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms.

Global atmospheric circulation systems called Hadley cells are created by warm air rising near the equator, traveling toward the poles and then cooling and sinking back toward Earth near 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. The Coriolis force created by Earth’s rotation deflects some of that downward-moving air toward the east, which forms the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs researchers were making sense of these changes to the westerlies, other scientists began using measurements of CO₂ levels in the atmosphere to determine whether the shifting, speedier westerlies are causing a drop in the amount of CO₂ being absorbed by the Southern Ocean. They had reason to suppose that this would happen.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLike any gas, carbon dioxide exerts a pressure that depends on the amount of the gas relative to other gases in a mixture. If this so-called partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO₂ of the ocean, then the ocean will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Otherwise it will release it. And as the westerlies get stronger, the pCO₂ of the Southern Ocean could change, due to shifts in the pattern of ocean currents.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe westerlies drive the Southern Ocean current that circles Antarctica. The predominantly west-to-east current is further acted upon by a force generated by Earth’s rotation, known as the Coriolis force, which deflects moving objects to their right in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere. The current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left, or northward, pushing the surface waters away from the pole.

This was a cause for concern, given that the Southern Ocean is “the most important marine carbon sink on the planet,” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a global database of pCO₂ values, created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in the sea or carried on research and commercial ships. Known as the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.socat.info\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSurface Ocean CO₂ Atlas\u003c/a\u003e (SOCAT) and established in 2007, it contains almost 26 million observations of global oceans and coastal seas from 1957 to 2019. Since data are sparser for the earlier decades than for recent years, Landschützer’s team filled in the gaps using other, less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as sea surface temperature and salinity and their well-understood relationship to pCO₂ of surface waters.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThey estimated that the Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001. The trend reversed in 2002, with the ocean acting as a more vigorous carbon sink all the way up to 2011. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43826-y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eFrom 2011 to 2016, however, the Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its carbon absorption\u003c/a\u003e. The team tried to find a link between the changes in the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ and the poleward-shifted westerlies. “We were quite surprised that we did not,” Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis called for an explanation, and the answer turned out to be complicated. Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are, indeed, increasing the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters near Antarctica. This effect, though, is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past. This would imply that there should be no overall change in the absorption of carbon. But Landschützer’s team found that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade. The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in different parts of the Southern Ocean known as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian sectors. Winds there seem to change every decade, as evidenced by about 35 years of data, and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends, Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer. The data for the winter season was spotty; it is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at that time. So Landschützer’s team used the richer summer data and the sparse winter data to extrapolate and account for the winter months as best they could.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut in recent years, researchers have started using floats that are offering a new, broader glimpse of winter goings-on in the Southern Ocean.

One way to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing, and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂, is to look at past climate evidence. Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island, which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania, midway between Australia and Antarctica. At latitude degrees 54S, it’s right in the main band of the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGetting to Macquarie Island is no small feat, even on the \u003cem\u003eAurora Australis,\u003c/em\u003e a 311-foot-long icebreaker.

This fresh water reduces the salinity, and hence the density, of the surface waters. The formation of dense, salty, cold water is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North, from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere. This process is being disrupted by climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2004, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.rapid.ac.uk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea project called RAPID\u003c/a\u003e has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N (stretching from Florida to Morocco), to directly measure changes in the velocity of the AMOC. The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down. But because of inherent decade-to-decade variations in the climate system, 15 years’ worth of direct measurements isn’t enough to establish a trend.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo Levke Caesar, then with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and her colleagues extended this record back in time by using actual measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016, combined with a high-resolution climate model to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ereconstruct the strength of the AMOC\u003c/a\u003e over the past 150 years or so. Their work shows that the circulation system’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990, then grew until the early 2000s, and then started declining again. Other scientists have found similar results. As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, “all climate models predict a slowdown of the AMOC,” Caesar says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north, a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere. This warming also intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole, leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean, which may contribute to global warming by weakening the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂. Since the likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic, this could further weaken the AMOC. It has all the makings of a system that’s slipping out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eA similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last ice age, raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million. This rise happened from about 17,500 years ago to 11,700 years ago, causing the deglaciation that made Earth more habitable. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity, and rising.

The cell forms as warm, moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then, as it cools and dries, much of it sinks down toward Earth at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. Lower in the atmosphere, this air moves back toward the equator, completing the cell. Some of this downward-moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator, and is deflected by Earth’s rotation, creating the westerlies. Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole, the bigger the size of the cell, the more the winds move toward the pole.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eData collected by weather balloons, satellites and other means going back to 1960 show that \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JD008861\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eEarth’s tropical belt has widened\u003c/a\u003e in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude, effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells.

With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed, much like an ice skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms.

If this so-called partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO₂ of the ocean, then the ocean will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Otherwise it will release it.

This was a cause for concern, given that the Southern Ocean is “the most important marine carbon sink on the planet,” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a global database of pCO₂ values, created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in the sea or carried on research and commercial ships.

The team tried to find a link between the changes in the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ and the poleward-shifted westerlies. “We were quite surprised that we did not,” Landschützer says.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis called for an explanation, and the answer turned out to be complicated. Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are, indeed, increasing the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters near Antarctica. This effect, though, is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past. This would imply that there should be no overall change in the absorption of carbon. But Landschützer’s team found that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade. The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in different parts of the Southern Ocean known as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian sectors. Winds there seem to change every decade, as evidenced by about 35 years of data, and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends, Landschützer says.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll of the above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer.

The phytoplankton photosynthesize the CO₂ in the water into organic molecules to build their bodies. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, sequestering the carbon for centuries. Some phytoplankton are consumed by larger organisms called zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by even bigger creatures whose carbon-rich fecal pellets and dead bodies can also end up on the ocean floor, burying ever more carbon in the deep waters.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe evidence from the SOCCOM floats suggests that it’s these deep waters that are upwelling during the Antarctic winters. “It's the old rotted water that normally takes hundreds of years to circulate out of the deep,” Russell says.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eScientists surmise that intensifying westerlies are bringing more of this carbon-rich deep water to the surface — but they need more evidence. One way to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing, and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂, is to look at past climate evidence. Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island, which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania, midway between Australia and Antarctica. At latitude degrees 54S, it’s right in the main band of the westerlies.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGetting to Macquarie Island is no small feat, even on the \u003cem\u003eAurora Australis,\u003c/em\u003e a 311-foot-long icebreaker. Despite its size, the ship can be tossed around by massive swells, the kind Shackleton wrote about. “You can be lying down in your bunk, rolling from side to side and head to toe as the ship swirls around,” Saunders says. “If you get seasick like me, it’s quite horrible.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOn Macquarie Island, Saunders and her colleagues capitalized on a fortuitous natural record that provides clues to how strongly the winds around the island have blown in the past. That record lies at the bottom of Emerald Lake, a body of freshwater on the island’s western edge. It’s exposed to the westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by the winds: The greater the wind speeds, the higher the salinity of the lake. The salinity in turn affects which species of diatoms, types of algae, can thrive in the lake.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen they die, diatoms sink to the bottom of the lake and are buried in sediments on the lakebed, creating a layered chronicle of the salinity of the lake — and by proxy the speed of the winds.

Saunders’ study supports the idea that as the westerlies speed up, the Southern Ocean will outgas more CO₂ — as shown by Gray’s report on wintertime data collected by the SOCCOM floats — and goes against the analysis of 35 years of ship-based data by Landschützer’s team. Only more studies, along the lines of Landschützer’s attempt to reconcile the various datasets, will help resolve this debate.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eAwakening a beast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere’s one more factor that could feed into the vicious cycle that scientists fear may already be underway in the Southern Ocean. Changes in the extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation system that includes the Gulf Stream may also be exacerbating the warming of the Southern Ocean, which in turn could be adding to the poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis circulation system, called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, brings warm, salty surface water to the north, where it cools and sinks and then heads back to the Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers. Scientists have found evidence that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0007-4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe AMOC has been slowing down\u003c/a\u003e, particularly in the last 150 years compared to the preceding 1,500 years. One indication of this is that particles being deposited on the ocean floor have been getting smaller and smaller: Fast-flowing water can whisk away smaller particles, allowing only the larger particles to settle, whereas slower water allows smaller and smaller particles to drop to the floor.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSome of the AMOC’s slowdown can be attributed to one of the consequences of global warming: an increasing supply of glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic. This fresh water reduces the salinity, and hence the density, of the surface waters. The formation of dense, salty, cold water is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North, from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere. This process is being disrupted by climate change.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSince 2004, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.rapid.ac.uk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea project called RAPID\u003c/a\u003e has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N (stretching from Florida to Morocco), to directly measure changes in the velocity of the AMOC. The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down. But because of inherent decade-to-decade variations in the climate system, 15 years’ worth of direct measurements isn’t enough to establish a trend.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo Levke Caesar, then with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and her colleagues extended this record back in time by using actual measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016, combined with a high-resolution climate model to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ereconstruct the strength of the AMOC\u003c/a\u003e over the past 150 years or so. Their work shows that the circulation system’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990, then grew until the early 2000s, and then started declining again. Other scientists have found similar results. As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, “all climate models predict a slowdown of the AMOC,” Caesar says.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBecause the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north, a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere. This warming also intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole, leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean, which may contribute to global warming by weakening the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂. Since the likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic, this could further weaken the AMOC. It has all the makings of a system that’s slipping out of control.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last ice age, raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million. This rise happened from about 17,500 years ago to 11,700 years ago, causing the deglaciation that made Earth more habitable. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity, and rising. In a mere 250 years, we have increased CO₂ levels by more than the amount that melted an icy planet over thousands of years.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe winds are howling again over the Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast that, until now, has been helping us by absorbing copious amounts of carbon.

The scene starts with the Milky Way’s disk (the small white oval at center) attended only by its two most luminous satellites, the Large Magellanic Cloud (blue dot labeled LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (blue dot SMC), then slowly adds what are called the classical dwarf spheroidals (other blue dots) that emerged into view from 1938 to 1994.

Just as every planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit, so every Milky Way satellite revolves around the galactic center in an elliptical orbit. And just as gravity causes the planets to move fastest when nearest the sun, so satellite galaxies speed up when nearest the Milky Way and slow down at their farthest. As a result, at any given time most satellite galaxies should be lingering around the farthest points in their orbits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Simon found something different — most of the \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aacdfb/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003e17 ultra-faint dwarf satellites he analyzed were close to their \u003cem\u003enear\u003c/em\u003e points\u003c/a\u003e instead. The most natural explanation, he says, is that scientists are seeing just a small fraction of the much larger number of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that are out there, most of which are at their orbital far points. But because they are farther away and harder to see, these additional galaxies have so far eluded discovery, Simon reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“For the next 10 years or so, I think the number of [satellite] galaxies will increase pretty dramatically,” says Vasily Belokurov, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge whose \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181104082T\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eteam has turned up many of the new galaxies\u003c/a\u003e. He suspects that the Milky Way has a total of roughly 200; even the most conservative estimates put the number at 100. And that makes the Milky Way even more of a galactic standout, in the top 1 percent, says Simon: Fully 99 percent of all galaxies would be smaller, fainter and less massive — giving our galactic home an A-plus from any cosmic teacher who grades the galaxies. If the total satellite population is as high as 200, we’d be in the top 0.5 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Composite image shows relative size of various galaxies, from very large, to a robust satellite galaxy to the recently discovered diffuse dwarf galaxy Antlia 2.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/297/P-antlia2_0.png\\\" title=\\\"Range of galaxies\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eShown to true relative scale: the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Milky Way’s brightest satellite (left); a Milky Way twin named NGC 6744 in the constellation Pavo (center); and an illustration of Antlia 2 (right), a large but dim satellite galaxy that turned up only in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n    \u003cp class=\\\"source\\\"\u003eCREDIT: COMPOSITE CREATED BY V.

Most are ultra-faint dwarfs; all are dimmer than the Milky Way. And last year, Simon made a surprising discovery suggesting that plenty more satellite galaxies await detection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimon drew that conclusion after mapping the positions of ultra-faint galaxies in their orbits around the Milky Way. Just as every planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit, so every Milky Way satellite revolves around the galactic center in an elliptical orbit. And just as gravity causes the planets to move fastest when nearest the sun, so satellite galaxies speed up when nearest the Milky Way and slow down at their farthest. As a result, at any given time most satellite galaxies should be lingering around the farthest points in their orbits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Simon found something different — most of the \u003ca href=\\\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aacdfb/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e17 ultra-faint dwarf satellites he analyzed were close to their \u003cem\u003enear\u003c/em\u003e points\u003c/a\u003e instead. The most natural explanation, he says, is that scientists are seeing just a small fraction of the much larger number of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that are out there, most of which are at their orbital far points. But because they are farther away and harder to see, these additional galaxies have so far eluded discovery, Simon reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“For the next 10 years or so, I think the number of [satellite] galaxies will increase pretty dramatically,” says Vasily Belokurov, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge whose \u003ca href=\\\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181104082T\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eteam has turned up many of the new galaxies\u003c/a\u003e. He suspects that the Milky Way has a total of roughly 200; even the most conservative estimates put the number at 100. And that makes the Milky Way even more of a galactic standout, in the top 1 percent, says Simon: Fully 99 percent of all galaxies would be smaller, fainter and less massive — giving our galactic home an A-plus from any cosmic teacher who grades the galaxies. If the total satellite population is as high as 200, we’d be in the top 0.5 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, we live in a galaxy that is far bigger, brighter and more massive than most other galaxies in the universe. And in all likelihood, so do most other life forms in the universe, if such exist. That’s because the small galaxies that throng the cosmos possess so few stars; our own galaxy has many more stars than all the galaxies revolving around it put together. So, in terms of pure numbers, if every star has exactly one planet that is exactly like Earth and teeming with life, it’s likely that most living beings in the universe reside in a galaxy that’s far above average.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the next time you’re speeding through intergalactic space in your brand new galaxyship — mere starships are \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e twenty-third century — you can brag to any aliens you meet beyond the Milky Way that you hail from a gargantuan galaxy.

Helium is the second most common element in the universe, after hydrogen, and neon ranks fifth or sixth.

But that’s only because the argon we breathe comes from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe universe is different. “In the interstellar medium,” says Schilke, “argon-36 is by far the most abundant, and we were just too stupid to realize it.” Argonium made with argon-36 absorbs and emits light at slightly different wavelengths than it does with argon-40, explaining why the scientists had missed the identification.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, once they recognized the existence of interstellar argonium, Schilke, Neufeld, Gerin and their colleagues sought to explain its formation. “This is a molecule that doesn’t like molecules,” Schilke says, just as argon is an atom that doesn’t like atoms. This peculiar characteristic is turning out to be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-center\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Pie chart shows isotopic abundances of argon on Earth versus in the universe.

First, a cosmic ray — a high-speed charged particle — strips an electron from an interstellar argon atom, making Ar\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Then that argon ion can steal a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen molecule (H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e) to create argonium, ArH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, because the hydrogen atom is more attracted to the argon ion than to its hydrogen mate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut argonium is fragile, and the same hydrogen molecules it requires for its formation can also destroy it. The noble gas molecule can therefore exist only where there’s just enough molecular hydrogen to create argonium but not so much as to tear it apart. This stringent requirement turns out to be handy for identifying which interstellar clouds aren’t likely to spawn new stars and planets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterstellar gas in our part of the Milky Way comes in two main types: atomic and molecular. The first and more common type consists primarily of individual hydrogen and helium atoms. Because atomic gas is diffuse, it rarely makes new stars. Instead, most stars arise in denser gas where atoms crowd together to create molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult to tell apart the interstellar clouds that consist mostly of atomic gas from those that consist mostly of molecular gas, and that’s where argonium comes in. “It’s a tracer of almost purely \u003cem\u003eatomic\u003c/em\u003e gas,” Schilke says. In fact, although argonium is a molecule, \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2014/06/aa23727-14/aa23727-14.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eit exists only in gas that’s 99.9 to 99.99 percent atomic\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause cosmic rays lead to the creation of argonium, its abundance in interstellar space has also helped nail down the number of cosmic rays darting through the galaxy. “There are more cosmic rays than we thought before,” Gerin says. That’s important not only for future Captain Kirks wishing to minimize their exposure to the destructive radiation as they travel between star systems, but also to scientists studying the chemistry of the interstellar medium, because cosmic rays are the first step in the creation of other molecules as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe universe’s first molecule\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven after the discovery of interstellar argonium, astronomers continued their quest for the simplest noble gas molecule, helium hydride, the one that theorists had predicted decades ago. “This is the first chemical bond that formed in the universe,” says astrophysicist Stephen Lepp of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe molecule arose because hydrogen and helium were the two chief elements to emerge from the big bang. At the beginning, the universe was so hot that any electrons either element managed to capture would immediately be stripped away by high-energy radiation generated by the extreme heat. But as space expanded, it cooled, and about 100,000 years after the big bang, each helium nucleus grabbed two electrons and became neutral.

This instrument successfully detected the far-infrared signature of HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e at a wavelength of 149 micrometers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGüsten and his colleagues succeeded by searching the same nebula where their predecessors had failed: NGC 7027 in the constellation Cygnus. Here, about 600 years ago, an aging star known as a red giant shed its atmosphere — something our own sun will do in about 7.8 billion years. This exposed the dying star’s hot core, which shines at a blistering 190,000 kelvins (340,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and emits extreme ultraviolet light that tears electrons from helium atoms, creating He\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Combine that with neutral hydrogen atoms from other parts of the nebula and you have HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e.

Helium is the second most common element in the universe, after hydrogen, and neon ranks fifth or sixth.

Because many molecules absorb and emit far-infrared light, this spectral range is a good place to seek new space molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin a year of Herschel’s launch, astronomers began noticing that something in interstellar space was absorbing far-infrared light at a wavelength of 485 microns, a spectral line that hadn’t been observed before. “Nobody could figure out what it was,” says David Neufeld, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of the 2016 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review\u003c/em\u003e article (and an acquaintance of the author of this story in graduate school). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchilke consulted colleagues in his group at Cologne and elsewhere. “We sat in the office at the whiteboard,” he says, “and we put all the possible molecules on there, including argonium.” No known molecule matched the observed wavelength of 485 microns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Barlow’s team was using Herschel data to study the Crab Nebula, the remains of a massive star our ancestors saw explode in the year 1054. The celestial fireworks forged argon and other “metals,” which astronomers define as all elements heavier than helium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the nebula’s argon-rich gas, Barlow and his colleagues spotted \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e unidentified spectral lines. One was the same mysterious line everyone else had been seeing at 485 microns; the other had exactly half the wavelength — the hallmark of a molecule containing two atoms. Barlow identified it as argonium, publishing the discovery in 2013. It was \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1343.abstract\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe first noble gas molecule ever found in nature\u003c/a\u003e. (Barlow notes that at the last minute the editors of his scientific paper changed “molecule” in the title to “molecular ion.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe discovery was a shock. “We were just stunned when we heard this,” Neufeld says. After all, astronomers had been seeing that same 485-micron spectral line elsewhere. “When I first heard about the detection,” Schilke says, “I was extremely embarrassed that we had not spotted this ourselves.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientists were the victims of a down-to-earth mix-up. They thought they knew the wavelengths argonium produced, because scientists had created it in the lab decades earlier and measured its spectrum. But these laboratory molecules contained argon-40, which is by far the most common argon isotope — on Earth. But that’s only because the argon we breathe comes from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe universe is different. “In the interstellar medium,” says Schilke, “argon-36 is by far the most abundant, and we were just too stupid to realize it.” Argonium made with argon-36 absorbs and emits light at slightly different wavelengths than it does with argon-40, explaining why the scientists had missed the identification.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, once they recognized the existence of interstellar argonium, Schilke, Neufeld, Gerin and their colleagues sought to explain its formation. “This is a molecule that doesn’t like molecules,” Schilke says, just as argon is an atom that doesn’t like atoms. This peculiar characteristic is turning out to be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eArgonium’s cosmic origins\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on standard calculations of how chemical reactions proceed in space, scientists know the formation of the interstellar argonium molecule requires two steps. First, a cosmic ray — a high-speed charged particle — strips an electron from an interstellar argon atom, making Ar\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Then that argon ion can steal a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen molecule (H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e) to create argonium, ArH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, because the hydrogen atom is more attracted to the argon ion than to its hydrogen mate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut argonium is fragile, and the same hydrogen molecules it requires for its formation can also destroy it. The noble gas molecule can therefore exist only where there’s just enough molecular hydrogen to create argonium but not so much as to tear it apart. This stringent requirement turns out to be handy for identifying which interstellar clouds aren’t likely to spawn new stars and planets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterstellar gas in our part of the Milky Way comes in two main types: atomic and molecular. The first and more common type consists primarily of individual hydrogen and helium atoms. Because atomic gas is diffuse, it rarely makes new stars. Instead, most stars arise in denser gas where atoms crowd together to create molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult to tell apart the interstellar clouds that consist mostly of atomic gas from those that consist mostly of molecular gas, and that’s where argonium comes in. “It’s a tracer of almost purely \u003cem\u003eatomic\u003c/em\u003e gas,” Schilke says. In fact, although argonium is a molecule, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2014/06/aa23727-14/aa23727-14.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eit exists only in gas that’s 99.9 to 99.99 percent atomic\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause cosmic rays lead to the creation of argonium, its abundance in interstellar space has also helped nail down the number of cosmic rays darting through the galaxy. “There are more cosmic rays than we thought before,” Gerin says. That’s important not only for future Captain Kirks wishing to minimize their exposure to the destructive radiation as they travel between star systems, but also to scientists studying the chemistry of the interstellar medium, because cosmic rays are the first step in the creation of other molecules as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe universe’s first molecule\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven after the discovery of interstellar argonium, astronomers continued their quest for the simplest noble gas molecule, helium hydride, the one that theorists had predicted decades ago. “This is the first chemical bond that formed in the universe,” says astrophysicist Stephen Lepp of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe molecule arose because hydrogen and helium were the two chief elements to emerge from the big bang. At the beginning, the universe was so hot that any electrons either element managed to capture would immediately be stripped away by high-energy radiation generated by the extreme heat. But as space expanded, it cooled, and about 100,000 years after the big bang, each helium nucleus grabbed two electrons and became neutral. Put H\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e and He together and you have the universe’s first molecule, HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo this day no one has ever detected any helium hydride in the early universe; that would require the unprecedented feat of looking across more than 13 billion light-years of space to the dawn of time and discerning the faint spectral line that the molecule produces. In April 2019, however, astronomers led by Rolf Güsten of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany reported finding \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1090-x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe long-sought molecule right here in the Milky Way\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGüsten’s team made the discovery not with a spacecraft but with a specialized airplane that flies above nearly all of the atmosphere’s water vapor, which blocks infrared radiation. The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy hunted for the coveted molecule using a telescope with a sensitive new high-resolution spectrometer. This instrument successfully detected the far-infrared signature of HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e at a wavelength of 149 micrometers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGüsten and his colleagues succeeded by searching the same nebula where their predecessors had failed: NGC 7027 in the constellation Cygnus. Here, about 600 years ago, an aging star known as a red giant shed its atmosphere — something our own sun will do in about 7.8 billion years. This exposed the dying star’s hot core, which shines at a blistering 190,000 kelvins (340,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and emits extreme ultraviolet light that tears electrons from helium atoms, creating He\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Combine that with neutral hydrogen atoms from other parts of the nebula and you have HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. In the early universe it was the other way around — charged hydrogen and neutral helium — but the end result was the same: HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, the first molecule to form after the big bang.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s the end of a long saga,” says Paul Goldsmith, an astronomer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved with the discovery. The detection proves that the calculations predicting the exotic molecule’s existence were correct, lending credence to expectations that the molecule did indeed take shape soon after the universe’s birth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere might be other noble gas molecules, too. In space, neon atoms greatly outnumber argon, so neonium, or NeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, could exist. If so, its abundance and the places it exists will further illuminate conditions in the interstellar medium. On the other hand, krypton is so rare that kryptonium probably poses little threat to any interstellar Superman, and xenon is rarer still.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s a vast universe with temperatures and densities that vary wildly from place to place and differ dramatically from those on Earth. Somewhere, in the nook of some distant interstellar cloud, the most unlikely atoms may have come together to create molecules even more bizarre than any yet found, awaiting only an intrepid observer to detect their spectral signature in the depths of space.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-121119-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://KenCroswell.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eKen Croswell\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is an astronomer and author.

For example, postelection analyses of the 2016 US election suggest that national election polling was about as accurate as it has always been. (State polls, however, were a different story.) Clinton, after all, won the popular vote by 2 percent, not far from the 3 percent average that the polls found, and within the range of errors seen in previous elections.

Pollsters recruit respondents with online ads offering reward points, coupons, even cash. This type of polling is relatively cheap and easy. The problem, however, is that it doesn’t sample a population in a random way.

One primary reason, it found, was that polls — particularly state polls — failed to account for voters with only a high school education. Normally, this wouldn’t have mattered much, as voting preferences among people with different education levels tend to balance each other out. But in an election that was anything but normal, non-college-educated voters tilted toward Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“College graduates are more likely to take surveys than people with less education,” says Kennedy, who chaired the AAPOR committee. “In 2016, people’s education levels were pretty correlated with how they voted for president, especially in key states.” This particular skew was unique to the 2016 election, but any kind of unrepresentative sample is the biggest source of error in polling, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePollsters have tools for predicting how skewed a sample might be and can try to correct for it by giving a proportionally larger weight to responses from any underrepresented groups. In the 2016 election, Kennedy says, many state polls didn’t perform the proper statistical weighting to account for an underrepresentation of non-college-educated voters. Some pollsters, she says, might be reluctant to apply this kind of weighting, citing the fact that they don’t know voters’ education levels ahead of time. Shoestring budgets also mean state polls tend to be of lower quality. (In 2016, their average error was 5.1 percentage points, compared to 2.2 for national polls.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEven if pollsters can perfectly account for skewed samples, the responses to surveys could themselves be problematic. Questionnaires could be poorly designed, filled with leading questions. Or respondents might not be telling the truth. For example, voters may not want to admit their true voting preferences. This phenomenon is dubbed the Bradley Effect, named after the 1982 California gubernatorial election in which longtime Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African American, lost to George Deukmejian, a white state official, despite leading in the polls.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the theory, voters would tell pollsters they would vote for the minority candidate to appear more open-minded, even though they would ultimately choose otherwise. Soon after the 2016 election, some election analysts suggested that a similar “shy Trump voter” effect may have been at play, although the AAPOR report didn’t find much evidence that it was.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTelling the future\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to write off the power of polls when they pick the wrong winner. But doing so misses the intended purpose (and acknowledged capability) of polling: to capture a snapshot of public opinion — not to make a prediction.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost surveys ask people what they think about topics like education policy or a president's job performance at that moment in time. Election polls, on the other hand, ask people to forecast their future behavior. Asking voters whom they would pick if the election were held today — technically not about the future — poses a hypothetical situation nonetheless.

They’re not perfect, but “they offer some reasonable guideposts about what the portrait is going to look like,” Kennedy says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last decade, predictive models — such as the ones by the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e and by Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight — have gained popularity. And these \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e designed to make forecasts. “One of the reasons to build a model — perhaps the most important reason — is to measure uncertainty and to account for risk,” Silver \u003ca href=\\\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ewrote three days after the 2016 election\u003c/a\u003e. “If polling were perfect, you wouldn’t need to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFiveThirtyEight’s most sophisticated model, for instance, incorporates polling data with demographic and economic data, tries to account for uncertainty, and then simulates thousands of elections to produce a probability of victory. These models also take the electoral college into account, which election polls don’t (probably another reason polls failed to pick Trump).\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eStill, these models depend on accurate polls, and no matter your statistical tool, you can never truly predict the future. Sometimes, voters change their minds. Or they don’t show on Election Day. And some voters don’t decide until the last minute. In fact, in addition to the undercounting of non-college-educated voters, this kind of late swing was the other major reason polls missed in 2016, according to the AAPOR report. Undecided voters in battleground states swung strongly in Trump’s direction — by as much as 29 percentage points in Wisconsin, for example. In most elections, Kennedy says, late swings end in a wash, with undecided voters going equally in both directions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003ePolling for democracy\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the shock wears off, discrepancies between polls and actual results usually aren’t as wide as they initially seem. In 2016, people were too complacent about Clinton’s chances — despite actual poll data and their uncertainties, according to Silver. Just looking at the numbers, he wrote, “We think people should have been better prepared for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePollsters and journalists thus need to be better at communicating uncertainties, says Ron Kenett, an applied statistician at the Samuel Neaman Institute at the Technion in Haifa, Israel, who recently wrote about polling issues in the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Statistics and Its Application\u003c/em\u003e.

For example, postelection analyses of the 2016 US election suggest that national election polling was about as accurate as it has always been. (State polls, however, were a different story.) Clinton, after all, won the popular vote by 2 percent, not far from the 3 percent average that the polls found, and within the range of errors seen in previous elections. Polls failed to anticipate a Trump victory not because of any fundamental flaws, but because of unusual circumstances that magnified typically small errors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone sort of walked away with the impression that polling was broken — that was not accurate,” says Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue may be one of expectations. Polls aren’t clairvoyant — especially if an election is close, which was the case in many of the recent surprises. Even with the most sophisticated polling techniques, errors are inevitable. Like any statistical measure, a poll contains nuances and uncertainties, which pundits and the public often overlook. It’s hard to gauge the sentiment of an entire nation — and harder still to predict weeks or even days ahead how people will think and act on Election Day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“As much as I think polls are valuable in society, they’re really not built to tell you who’s going to be the winner of a close election,” Kennedy says. “They’re simply not precise enough to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eWould you like to take a survey?\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePollsters do their best to be accurate, with several survey methods at their disposal. These days, polling is in the midst of a transition. While phone, mail-in and even (rarely) door-to-door surveys are still done, more and more polls are happening online. Pollsters recruit respondents with online ads offering reward points, coupons, even cash. This type of polling is relatively cheap and easy. The problem, however, is that it doesn’t sample a population in a random way. An example of what’s called a non-probability approach or convenience sampling, the Internet survey panels include only people who are online and willing to click on survey ads (or who really love coupons).

Shoestring budgets also mean state polls tend to be of lower quality. (In 2016, their average error was 5.1 percentage points, compared to 2.2 for national polls.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEven if pollsters can perfectly account for skewed samples, the responses to surveys could themselves be problematic. Questionnaires could be poorly designed, filled with leading questions. Or respondents might not be telling the truth. For example, voters may not want to admit their true voting preferences. This phenomenon is dubbed the Bradley Effect, named after the 1982 California gubernatorial election in which longtime Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African American, lost to George Deukmejian, a white state official, despite leading in the polls.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the theory, voters would tell pollsters they would vote for the minority candidate to appear more open-minded, even though they would ultimately choose otherwise. Soon after the 2016 election, some election analysts suggested that a similar “shy Trump voter” effect may have been at play, although the AAPOR report didn’t find much evidence that it was.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTelling the future\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to write off the power of polls when they pick the wrong winner. But doing so misses the intended purpose (and acknowledged capability) of polling: to capture a snapshot of public opinion — not to make a prediction.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost surveys ask people what they think about topics like education policy or a president's job performance at that moment in time. Election polls, on the other hand, ask people to forecast their future behavior. Asking voters whom they would pick if the election were held today — technically not about the future — poses a hypothetical situation nonetheless. This hypothetical nature of election polling is what makes it uniquely challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re surveying a population that doesn’t yet exist,” Dutwin says. “We don’t know who’s going to show up at the ballot box.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTo create a more accurate portrait of who’s going to show up, some pollsters have developed likely voter models, statistical models that incorporate information like a person’s voting history. They’re not perfect, but “they offer some reasonable guideposts about what the portrait is going to look like,” Kennedy says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last decade, predictive models — such as the ones by the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e and by Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight — have gained popularity. And these \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e designed to make forecasts. “One of the reasons to build a model — perhaps the most important reason — is to measure uncertainty and to account for risk,” Silver \u003ca href=\\\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewrote three days after the 2016 election\u003c/a\u003e. “If polling were perfect, you wouldn’t need to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFiveThirtyEight’s most sophisticated model, for instance, incorporates polling data with demographic and economic data, tries to account for uncertainty, and then simulates thousands of elections to produce a probability of victory. These models also take the electoral college into account, which election polls don’t (probably another reason polls failed to pick Trump).\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eStill, these models depend on accurate polls, and no matter your statistical tool, you can never truly predict the future. Sometimes, voters change their minds. Or they don’t show on Election Day. And some voters don’t decide until the last minute. In fact, in addition to the undercounting of non-college-educated voters, this kind of late swing was the other major reason polls missed in 2016, according to the AAPOR report. Undecided voters in battleground states swung strongly in Trump’s direction — by as much as 29 percentage points in Wisconsin, for example. In most elections, Kennedy says, late swings end in a wash, with undecided voters going equally in both directions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003ePolling for democracy\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the shock wears off, discrepancies between polls and actual results usually aren’t as wide as they initially seem. In 2016, people were too complacent about Clinton’s chances — despite actual poll data and their uncertainties, according to Silver. Just looking at the numbers, he wrote, “We think people should have been better prepared for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePollsters and journalists thus need to be better at communicating uncertainties, says Ron Kenett, an applied statistician at the Samuel Neaman Institute at the Technion in Haifa, Israel, who recently wrote about polling issues in the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Statistics and Its Application\u003c/em\u003e. The public doesn’t usually consider statistical uncertainties, he says. “People will get hung up on supposedly clear pictures even though they are blurred.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhile election polls will never provide a crystal clear view of the future, they’re still necessary for taking the pulse of the electorate. “Polls are a critical tool for democracy,” Dutwin says. “Democracy requires that we know what we think about things, because otherwise, the politicians are just going to tell us what we think.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-110519-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMarcus Woo\u003c/b\u003e is a freelance science journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It’s the sense that we, whoever “we” are, have been entrusted with the responsibility for something that really belongs to another. Earth is not exactly our property, then; it’s something that we have to take care of and that we’re responsible for, to some transcendent authority — God, in these religions, but stewardship might also be used in a sense that we’re responsible to the nation or to future generations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of stewardship is criticized for being anthropocentric, for having a strong, distinct role of humans: The human is a steward in a way that all the other creatures are not. And that seems to risk endorsing strong interventions — for example, climate engineering or exploitation of resources. But stewardship does not necessarily lend itself to domination or exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome have interpreted a biblical reference known as the “dominion mandate” to mean that people should extract as many resources from the Earth as possible. A famous example is Scott Pruitt, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has said that people have a responsibility to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/february/unraveling-the-weaponization-of-the-epa-is-top-priority-for-scott-pruitt\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003e“harvest the natural resources\u003c/a\u003e.” Can you explain the dominion mandate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea that humans have a mandate to dominion arises from the first pages of the Hebrew scriptures and their creation narratives. There’s a verse in which humans are told to subdue the Earth, fill it and have dominion. I’ll say that this is followed very quickly by a second creation story, the Eden story, including Adam and Eve. It’s a completely separate story of beginnings, with different Hebrew vocabulary than what appears in Genesis 1. In the second story, humans are to tend and guard the Earth, whereas in Genesis 1, they are to subdue and have dominion over it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is generally held that the two stories were written by different communities at different times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo right off the bat there’s this internal debate — but nonetheless, there’s certainly a scriptural warrant to the idea that humans have dominion.

Some evangelicals think that a dominion mandate should lead toward increasing fossil-fuel energy. Other evangelicals think that it means humans need to take responsibility for fossil-fuel use and maybe draw down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearch shows that white evangelicals in the United States are more likely to be climate sceptics than people of other religious affiliations. They may cite dominion to explain their position. In their interpretation, global climate governance would impede free exploitation of natural resources and, by slowing economic growth, worsen prospects for human welfare. That view does not seem to be based in credible social science, but the point is that they appeal to dominion to symbolize the importance of human dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, non-white evangelicals in the US, and evangelicals in other countries, have a much lower correlation between their religious affiliation and climate scepticism. The difference suggests that what we are seeing is not simply a structure of religious belief shaping a particular climate policy. Rather, religious beliefs and political context feed back on one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do these different groups of evangelicals interpret dominion differently?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not irrelevant that white evangelicals in the United States are affiliated with fossil-fuel production in a way that other evangelicals are not. There’s evidence that white US evangelical Christianity is becoming a kind of faction in and of itself. I think this will create an increasing problem for global evangelicalism, which will have to decide whether this faction still belongs to their wider family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s an \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.lausanne.org/content/ctc/ctcommitment#p2-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eimportant global evangelical statement from 2011\u003c/a\u003e that says climate change is a grave moral problem of our time. So evangelicals around the world may come to look at this denialist faction as a kind of odd faction. US evangelicals just take up all the space because they are incredibly politically powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome researchers see this division explained more by religious identity while others see it explained more by political identity.

A famous example is Scott Pruitt, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has said that people have a responsibility to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/february/unraveling-the-weaponization-of-the-epa-is-top-priority-for-scott-pruitt\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e“harvest the natural resources\u003c/a\u003e.” Can you explain the dominion mandate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea that humans have a mandate to dominion arises from the first pages of the Hebrew scriptures and their creation narratives. There’s a verse in which humans are told to subdue the Earth, fill it and have dominion. I’ll say that this is followed very quickly by a second creation story, the Eden story, including Adam and Eve. It’s a completely separate story of beginnings, with different Hebrew vocabulary than what appears in Genesis 1. In the second story, humans are to tend and guard the Earth, whereas in Genesis 1, they are to subdue and have dominion over it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is generally held that the two stories were written by different communities at different times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo right off the bat there’s this internal debate — but nonetheless, there’s certainly a scriptural warrant to the idea that humans have dominion. Then the big question is: What does dominion mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClimate change is an interesting religious case because it is an example where debate over the meaning of a scriptural concept is happening in real time. Some evangelicals think that a dominion mandate should lead toward increasing fossil-fuel energy. Other evangelicals think that it means humans need to take responsibility for fossil-fuel use and maybe draw down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearch shows that white evangelicals in the United States are more likely to be climate sceptics than people of other religious affiliations. They may cite dominion to explain their position. In their interpretation, global climate governance would impede free exploitation of natural resources and, by slowing economic growth, worsen prospects for human welfare. That view does not seem to be based in credible social science, but the point is that they appeal to dominion to symbolize the importance of human dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, non-white evangelicals in the US, and evangelicals in other countries, have a much lower correlation between their religious affiliation and climate scepticism. The difference suggests that what we are seeing is not simply a structure of religious belief shaping a particular climate policy. Rather, religious beliefs and political context feed back on one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do these different groups of evangelicals interpret dominion differently?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not irrelevant that white evangelicals in the United States are affiliated with fossil-fuel production in a way that other evangelicals are not. There’s evidence that white US evangelical Christianity is becoming a kind of faction in and of itself. I think this will create an increasing problem for global evangelicalism, which will have to decide whether this faction still belongs to their wider family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s an \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.lausanne.org/content/ctc/ctcommitment#p2-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eimportant global evangelical statement from 2011\u003c/a\u003e that says climate change is a grave moral problem of our time. So evangelicals around the world may come to look at this denialist faction as a kind of odd faction. US evangelicals just take up all the space because they are incredibly politically powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome researchers see this division explained more by religious identity while others see it explained more by political identity. White evangelicals in the United States tend to identify as Republican and have followed the Republican Party’s hardening opposition to climate policy. Which factor is more significant, and how do they interact? That’s the subject of ongoing research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBesides white evangelical Christianity, how do some of the other religions interpret dominion?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor any religious community that has a view of a strong, unique role for humans in managing the Earth, one possible variant of that is that there’s a mandate to extract. But religious voices within those Abrahamic faiths will often say that extractivist dominion is not a legitimate religious world view, but a kind of secular distortion of it — the disfiguring of religion and abandoning of real responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePope Francis’ Climate Encyclical, \u003ca href=\\\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLaudato si’\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, focuses on how to interpret dominion, what it has meant and what it should mean. His view of dominion is basically that it is contemplative, that it is about understanding the meaning of other creatures. Francis rejects the idea that God wants humans to exploit natural resources without limit. That is profoundly different from the idea that dominion means that property-owners have a mandate to take material resources from the Earth to support projects of wealth-building, which is an idea that really caught on during \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.livescience.com/55327-the-enlightenment.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe Enlightenment\u003c/a\u003e and industrial modernity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the dynamics that I’ve mentioned already about the fault lines within religions, like evangelical Christianity, certainly hold true in other religious contexts. Buddhist interpretations of climate change in the world’s greatest carbon emitter — China — are different from the way Buddhism interprets climate change in nearby Bhutan, which is a carbon-negative country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Bhutan, policies that favor conservation over economic growth are more likely to be construed as in line with classical Buddhism, whereas in China, economic growth is prioritized. That’s an oversimplification, because Bhutanese Buddhism derives from a different school than most Buddhism in China, where it also mixes with Daoism and Confucianism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the basic pattern holds: China’s carbon-intensive energy regime creates an incentive to interpret Buddhist teachings as supporting the state’s moderate climate policies, while Bhutan’s conservation-focused energy regime creates an incentive to interpret Buddhist teachings as supporting the state’s more robust climate policies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIslam is widely different across different contexts. Saudi Arabia’s oil-fueled geopolitical power has caused its version of Islam to massively influence the shape of global Islam. Some even —pejoratively — call its Wahhabism “petro-Islam.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Islam is also an important part of the religious background of places where people are already climate-vulnerable. Especially in Indonesia, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-combines-islam-with-environmental-activism/a-44220277\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethere are a number of Islamic-formed climate movements\u003c/a\u003e.

Obviously, the Pope’s encyclical, \u003cem\u003eLaudato si’\u003c/em\u003e, is a very visible intervention into global climate discourse. It was interesting to read the way that \u003cem\u003eLaudato si’\u003c/em\u003e was concerned that solutionism, when it comes to climate change — for example, geoengineering and carbon offsets — will likely reinforce the power of the elite over the poor, and more broadly, humanity over the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.ifees.org.uk/declaration/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eThe Islamic Declaration on Climate Change\u003c/a\u003e is also an important global statement that was made in advance of the Paris Conference of the Parties in 2015, and it makes a pan-Islamic case for specific, robust climate policies. Key leaders of that initiative are located outside the oil-producing countries, although they have worked to create connections across the fossil divides.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it’s important to mention the networks of indigenous peoples.

It’s encouraging that so much informal spirituality and so many new religious expressions are environment-related. There’s a real cultural hunger for nature-based spiritualities to recover and restore and heal these connections between people and the Earth. All of that is encouraging for cultural repair of broken ecological relations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo centuries from now, I wonder if historians of religion will trace back to this time the first fissures that led to major reorganization of religious affiliation. For example, it seems possible that, if the white evangelicals in the United States continue along their current trajectory, they will come to be regarded by future historians as an ethno-nationalist breakaway from global evangelicalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also seems possible that, if many indigenous peoples continue to articulate a nature-focused political view in response to climate change, future historians will regard the climate crisis as a key contributor to an indigenous renaissance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd insofar as climate change makes secular people question the pursuits of their lives, the stories they live by, the purposes of capitalism, etc. — then climate change may be experienced by them as religious in depth.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-090319-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eStephanie Parker\u003c/b\u003e is a freelance environmental journalist and photographer based in Switzerland.

The older view of the Maya was of a non-urban, peaceful people ruled by priest-astronomers. The elaborate temples people had found at Tikal and elsewhere were thought to be merely ceremonial centers with minimal populations, and not cities in their own right. But mapping projects at Tikal and other places showed that they weren’t just ceremonial centers — there were large numbers of remains of houses. These were actually urban centers of some kind. That totally changed the understanding of the pre-Columbian Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you choose to focus on the archaeology of commoners?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are really two answers to that. One is, I was a student of Willey’s. I started in 1965 on a project in the tropical rainforest of Guatemala that was looking at the full range of Maya remains. So I was thrust into that. But also it was related to my general interest, which was: How do we understand the development through time of Maya civilization? Clearly, if you were going to ask questions like that and get useful answers, you had to look at the full range of ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you study settlement patterns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to get a sense of the distribution of all the kinds of housing and how they’re situated on the landscape, and in particular find information about the inhabitants of the different kinds of architecture through detailed collection of materials on the surface, and excavation where that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the projects that I co-directed was at the site of \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/laii_research/22/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSayil\u003c/a\u003e in northern Yucatan, south of modern-day Merida. We wanted first of all just to produce a map of the urban area, so we could get some idea of the extent and nature of the structures. One reason we chose to work at Sayil is that there had been very little disturbance after the 16th century. Where there had been a wooden thatched house, the single row of stones that supported the wooden poles of the walls was still there, so you could actually see the layout of rooms, the platforms they might have been built on, and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of a man crouched down brushing dirt.

Could we get a sense of household composition? How many rooms would a family have had? What would we find in the kitchen area? One of the interesting things we found is that open spaces between houses, which used to be thought of as small plazas or something, in fact were vegetable gardens where they’d been growing beans, squash, tomatoes and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found stone tools made of obsidian, which is not available locally. So you start getting into questions of trade. Economically, where could you find marketplaces? What was being sold there? Were goods accessible to both elite and non-elite, or are some things available only to one and not the other? All of those let you ask questions about how the ancient society functioned, and also how this might have changed through time. It’s a much richer picture of pre-Columbian ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe richer picture we’re getting of the 100 percent is aided by tools that archaeologists 50 years ago just didn’t have available. In terms of settlement-pattern mapping, one of the huge technical breakthroughs in recent years is remote sensing, particularly LIDAR, where low-flying aircraft or drones send down laser beams and you can see the ground without the trees. You can see stone courses. You can see the remains of houses, causeways, roads, defensive fortifications. That’s going to make the mapping of sites much simpler, particularly in difficult situations like tropical rainforest or a heavily wooded area. We’re able to cover much bigger areas with much greater detail and accuracy than ever before. New LIDAR-based studies in the Southern Maya Lowlands are showing that many pre-Columbian Maya cities were more extensive than previously thought, although these new data are awaiting confirmation by on-the-ground research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the lives of commoners like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, what we learned is it’s difficult to talk about Maya peoples as a whole at any one time. Throughout the Maya area — and that covers parts of modern-day Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — there was a great deal of variability, both through space and through time. Someone living in a small town in Northern Yucatan may be different from Maya living in the highlands of Guatemala or Honduras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an agricultural society. But clearly you had artisans of all sorts. Some of them are family-based, producing pottery, stone tools, decorative materials; others — for example, weavers or those making especially beautiful painted pottery — might be supported by the elite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas looking at the whole picture given scholars a different view of postclassical Maya civilization?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best sites for understanding that is the city of Mayapan, not too far from modern-day Merida in the Yucatan. There’s been work going on there for a number of years by a large international team. This was a walled city that thrived mainly from the mid-13th to mid-15th centuries. It was thought to be a decadent period — Maya gone downhill — because you didn’t have these large investments in beautiful architecture, in the temples and palaces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we found that economically and socially, things were just as complex, if not more complex. The rulers of the city weren’t sinking their capital into grand architecture or elaborate tombs, they were using it to develop warehouses, trading routes, boats — all the infrastructure of local and long-distance trade. To my mind, that’s not decadent at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of stone ruins.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/318/P-mayapan-yucatan_2.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Mayapan ruins\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ruins of Mayapan, in Yucatan, Mexico, abandoned in the 15th century, has fewer and less elaborate temples and large buildings than older sites like Tikal.

What were they successful at? What did not work? How were they resilient in the face of drought or warfare?

One reason is there were a lot more jobs available, particularly at state universities. And you started to be able to get grants for fieldwork that wasn’t based on looking for objects or spectacular finds.

It’s not that houses of ancient Maya peasantry had been ignored, but Willey was the first to concentrate attention on these and say: How can we understand Maya society as a whole?\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n\\n      \\n    \u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis concern with settlement pattern, with looking at the 100 percent instead of just the 1 percent, not only broadened our understanding, but completely changed it. The older view of the Maya was of a non-urban, peaceful people ruled by priest-astronomers. The elaborate temples people had found at Tikal and elsewhere were thought to be merely ceremonial centers with minimal populations, and not cities in their own right. But mapping projects at Tikal and other places showed that they weren’t just ceremonial centers — there were large numbers of remains of houses. These were actually urban centers of some kind. That totally changed the understanding of the pre-Columbian Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you choose to focus on the archaeology of commoners?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are really two answers to that. One is, I was a student of Willey’s. I started in 1965 on a project in the tropical rainforest of Guatemala that was looking at the full range of Maya remains. So I was thrust into that. But also it was related to my general interest, which was: How do we understand the development through time of Maya civilization? Clearly, if you were going to ask questions like that and get useful answers, you had to look at the full range of ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you study settlement patterns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to get a sense of the distribution of all the kinds of housing and how they’re situated on the landscape, and in particular find information about the inhabitants of the different kinds of architecture through detailed collection of materials on the surface, and excavation where that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the projects that I co-directed was at the site of \u003ca href=\\\"https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/laii_research/22/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSayil\u003c/a\u003e in northern Yucatan, south of modern-day Merida. We wanted first of all just to produce a map of the urban area, so we could get some idea of the extent and nature of the structures. One reason we chose to work at Sayil is that there had been very little disturbance after the 16th century. Where there had been a wooden thatched house, the single row of stones that supported the wooden poles of the walls was still there, so you could actually see the layout of rooms, the platforms they might have been built on, and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also did a little \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/jfa.1989.16.3.273\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eexcavation of these more perishable structures\u003c/a\u003e, so we could fill in a little more. Could we get a sense of household composition? How many rooms would a family have had? What would we find in the kitchen area? One of the interesting things we found is that open spaces between houses, which used to be thought of as small plazas or something, in fact were vegetable gardens where they’d been growing beans, squash, tomatoes and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found stone tools made of obsidian, which is not available locally. So you start getting into questions of trade. Economically, where could you find marketplaces? What was being sold there? Were goods accessible to both elite and non-elite, or are some things available only to one and not the other? All of those let you ask questions about how the ancient society functioned, and also how this might have changed through time. It’s a much richer picture of pre-Columbian ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe richer picture we’re getting of the 100 percent is aided by tools that archaeologists 50 years ago just didn’t have available. In terms of settlement-pattern mapping, one of the huge technical breakthroughs in recent years is remote sensing, particularly LIDAR, where low-flying aircraft or drones send down laser beams and you can see the ground without the trees. You can see stone courses. You can see the remains of houses, causeways, roads, defensive fortifications. That’s going to make the mapping of sites much simpler, particularly in difficult situations like tropical rainforest or a heavily wooded area. We’re able to cover much bigger areas with much greater detail and accuracy than ever before. New LIDAR-based studies in the Southern Maya Lowlands are showing that many pre-Columbian Maya cities were more extensive than previously thought, although these new data are awaiting confirmation by on-the-ground research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the lives of commoners like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, what we learned is it’s difficult to talk about Maya peoples as a whole at any one time. Throughout the Maya area — and that covers parts of modern-day Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — there was a great deal of variability, both through space and through time. Someone living in a small town in Northern Yucatan may be different from Maya living in the highlands of Guatemala or Honduras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an agricultural society. But clearly you had artisans of all sorts. Some of them are family-based, producing pottery, stone tools, decorative materials; others — for example, weavers or those making especially beautiful painted pottery — might be supported by the elite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas looking at the whole picture given scholars a different view of postclassical Maya civilization?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best sites for understanding that is the city of Mayapan, not too far from modern-day Merida in the Yucatan. There’s been work going on there for a number of years by a large international team. This was a walled city that thrived mainly from the mid-13th to mid-15th centuries. It was thought to be a decadent period — Maya gone downhill — because you didn’t have these large investments in beautiful architecture, in the temples and palaces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we found that economically and socially, things were just as complex, if not more complex. The rulers of the city weren’t sinking their capital into grand architecture or elaborate tombs, they were using it to develop warehouses, trading routes, boats — all the infrastructure of local and long-distance trade. To my mind, that’s not decadent at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there lessons we can learn from the Maya that apply today?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClassical Maya civilization collapsed in the 9th century, but the Maya didn’t disappear — there are over 10 million Maya speakers today. What allowed them to continue after their cities collapsed?

What were they successful at? What did not work? How were they resilient in the face of drought or warfare?

I think this is why archaeology classes are still booming around the country today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd archaeology goes on up to the present day. There’s a huge interest in this country in the archaeology of slavery. Even though that’s recent history, the written history did not give you the same kind of detail of the lives of the slaves as they did of the people living in the main house. Archaeology is helping reveal that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are archaeologists looking at the remains of homeless camps to try to get more insights into something that’s happening today.

I have been involved in a number of projects attempting to show genetic change, but it turns out to be challenging. This partly reflects the highly polygenic nature of traits such as body size and maturation. Almost every gene has an effect on body size, and so does the environment. The selection response is therefore quite spread out across the genome, and not very large at any single gene.

They found that many growth-related genes were involved in the changes, but that the precise nature of the changes differed from one experiment to the next. In some cases, whole blocks of genes changed together, enabling a rapid response to the selective pressure exerted by the experiment.

There’s little doubt that this is too many — fish populations have collapsed worldwide. But there’s another thing we are doing to fish: By killing them in such large numbers, we are exerting enormous evolutionary selection pressure. The adaptive changes that result could increase the chance that fish species will survive, but may pose a problem for the people who depend on them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBy preferentially catching the kind of fish we like — usually big ones — we are inevitably creating a disadvantageous situation for such fish. They’re less likely to survive and reproduce, which reduces the presence of their genes in the next generation. We are, in effect, creating evolutionary pressure for fish to be small.

I have been involved in a number of projects attempting to show genetic change, but it turns out to be challenging. This partly reflects the highly polygenic nature of traits such as body size and maturation. Almost every gene has an effect on body size, and so does the environment. The selection response is therefore quite spread out across the genome, and not very large at any single gene.

But some of our data and models can provide valuable input to that discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any efforts to try to modify those models so they can be used to fine-tune policies?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt is something we have been advocating, but many of the fisheries biologists who advise these policies are more concerned with the more immediate effects of overexploitation. And policies are often slow to change, so including these evolutionary considerations will probably be a long-term process. In the meantime, we can use these models to create more awareness, also among the public.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there anything consumers can do?

Global measures also fail to account for the natural carbon “sinks” — the portion of carbon dioxide emissions that are taken up by the oceans and land.

To get a picture of the carbon dioxide a country emits by burning fossil fuels, all energy use must first be counted. These assessments are already carried out for economic reasons and include tabulating the quantities of different fuels — such as coal, gas or kerosene — that are produced, traded, converted or used by a country across all sectors. While the contribution of large sources such as power plants can be relatively straightforward to assess, other ledger entries — such as household activities — “are very hard to account for,” says Chan. Accurately estimating these sources requires surveys to assess what goes on within a typical home and extrapolating from those.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"A map has been distorted to reflect each nation’s per capita carbon dioxide emission.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/381/G-world-co2-emissions-map_2.png\\\" title=\\\"Carbon footprints\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eCountries are resized to reflect their 2016 carbon dioxide emissions, with shading indicating the level of their per capita emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n    \u003cp class=\\\"source\\\"\u003eCREDIT: WORLDMAPPER.ORG / DATA BY EMISSION DATABASE FOR GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (EDGAR)\u003c/p\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigures from these energy assessments can be used to estimate national carbon dioxide emissions.

For example, if a refinery disappears from the data, it’s essential to find out whether its absence was caused by the refinery closing or by being missed in the reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIssues can also crop up when converting energy use to emissions.

This huge miscalculation was primarily caused by a misassessment of the quality of the coal burned in Chinese power plants. Given the scale of China’s emissions (currently higher than those of any other nation, although not on a per person basis), some errors are not a surprise, says climate scientist Corinne Le Quéré, who leads the annual Global Carbon Budget report. “I don’t want to give them excuses, but it’s a big challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat about tracking smaller, less obvious sources of carbon? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, one of the biggest challenges in tracking carbon dioxide emissions isn’t related to burning fossil fuels at all.

The report included emissions only up to 2004, and this chain of delays meant that there was a half-decade gap between policy and reality. These five years — it was later shown — had seen a significant increase in emissions, and the scenarios in terms of emissions and temperature targets sketched out in the negotiations were misaligned with the real world.

In 1965, Keeling’s measurements were incorporated into a report for US President Lyndon B. Johnson that described carbon dioxide from fossil fuels as “the invisible pollutant” and warned of its dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince then, global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have continued to rise, as have the concerns over the changes that such an atmospheric shift brings. Both of these trends took center stage this week in Madrid, where the United Nations is holding its annual climate change summit, the 25\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Conference of the Parties (COP25).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObservations are still taken at Mauna Loa today, and the resulting “Keeling Curve” reveals that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased by almost a third since the first measurements were taken.

Global measures also fail to account for the natural carbon “sinks” — the portion of carbon dioxide emissions that are taken up by the oceans and land. For a clear picture of national emissions, researchers have to start from the bottom up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow do you calculate a country’s carbon emissions?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn theory this is just a matter of math, but in practice it’s a question of huge-scale accounting. To get a picture of the carbon dioxide a country emits by burning fossil fuels, all energy use must first be counted. These assessments are already carried out for economic reasons and include tabulating the quantities of different fuels — such as coal, gas or kerosene — that are produced, traded, converted or used by a country across all sectors. While the contribution of large sources such as power plants can be relatively straightforward to assess, other ledger entries — such as household activities — “are very hard to account for,” says Chan. Accurately estimating these sources requires surveys to assess what goes on within a typical home and extrapolating from those.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigures from these energy assessments can be used to estimate national carbon dioxide emissions. Inventories provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change list the amount of carbon dioxide released when an amount of a particular fuel is burned. These “emissions factors” can be combined with energy data to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that will be released from all of a nation’s fossil fuel combustion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe International Energy Agency, which has been collecting energy data for over 40 years and calculates its own statistics on emissions, recognizes the difficulty in getting it right. “We do really spend a substantial part of our time validating the data,” says Roberta Quadrelli of the IEA’s Energy Data Centre. For example, if a refinery disappears from the data, it’s essential to find out whether its absence was caused by the refinery closing or by being missed in the reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIssues can also crop up when converting energy use to emissions. A \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14677\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e2015 study\u003c/a\u003e found that in one year China’s emissions had been overestimated by some 14 percent. “The error bar was like an entire Germany,” says Chan. This huge miscalculation was primarily caused by a misassessment of the quality of the coal burned in Chinese power plants. Given the scale of China’s emissions (currently higher than those of any other nation, although not on a per person basis), some errors are not a surprise, says climate scientist Corinne Le Quéré, who leads the annual Global Carbon Budget report. “I don’t want to give them excuses, but it’s a big challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat about tracking smaller, less obvious sources of carbon? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, one of the biggest challenges in tracking carbon dioxide emissions isn’t related to burning fossil fuels at all. Certain changes in land use — such as deforestation or urbanization — can lead to an uptick in carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-042009-094508\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethrough a number of complex processes\u003c/a\u003e.

The complexity of tabulating national emission totals also causes delays in reporting. These delays can make a big difference for policy. Official statistics may take many months to appear, meaning negotiators are often working with outdated information, says Niklas Höhne, who founded Climate Action Tracker, which monitors nations’ climate commitments and actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the extreme end, during the Copenhagen climate negotiations in 2009, negotiators were working with an IPCC report published in 2007. The report included emissions only up to 2004, and this chain of delays meant that there was a half-decade gap between policy and reality. These five years — it was later shown — had seen a significant increase in emissions, and the scenarios in terms of emissions and temperature targets sketched out in the negotiations were misaligned with the real world. Even as they were unveiled, they were out of date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs there any way to directly monitor carbon emissions?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven the difficulties, climate researchers are exploring other ways to count carbon that could allow for more up-to-date data.

Other items are recovered for burning in incinerators that provide energy for industry, such as in cement factories. A hefty portion of plastic is used once and then goes to landfills or escapes into the environment.

Compared with traditional, petroleum-based plastics, these bioplastics are an improvement. They have a smaller carbon footprint — they don’t release extra carbon that’s been locked up in fossil fuels — and are based on renewable resources. But just because something is made from plants doesn’t mean it’s biodegradable: Some bioplastics aren’t, while some petroleum-based plastics are, says Ramani Narayan, a chemical engineer at Michigan State University.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePlastics consist of long molecular chains called polymers, made up of repeating subunits strung together. Whether they’re biodegradable depends on the strength of this chain. For common plastics like the polyethylene and polypropylene used in bags and bottles, or the polystyrene that’s commonly known as Styrofoam, the links of the chain are particularly strong.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s like a string of pearls,” says Curt Frank, a chemical engineer at Stanford University. “These pearls are connected by carbon-carbon bonds, and those carbon bonds are very strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe links in biodegradable plastics are weaker, often involving chemical groups called esters, for example. Water, acids and enzymes — including those produced by certain microbes — can break those ester links, eventually leaving compounds such as carbon dioxide and water, which can be consumed by nature, and methane, which can be captured as fuel or fed to microbes.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Graphic shows a jumble of polymer chains and the steps required for them to completely breakdown in the environment.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/295/G-what-does-biodegradable-mean.svg\\\" title=\\\"Defining biodegradable\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eClaims that some plastics are “biodegradable” or “compostable,” when they actually persist in the environment for a very long time, have led to a push for stricter definitions. A plastic is biodegradable only if it breaks down into fragments that can be completely consumed by microorganisms in the disposal environment within a defined time period. The American Society of the International Association for Testing and Material has set standards for claims of “compostable” that include, for example, that 90 percent of the organic carbon must be used by compost microorganisms in no more than 180 days.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut biodegradability in itself isn’t necessarily meaningful, Narayan says. (“Human feces is biodegradable,” he says. “That doesn’t allow you to throw it anywhere.”) Different materials biodegrade under different conditions, and if those conditions aren’t available, then the material can be just as bad as regular plastic. For example, those increasingly familiar corn-based cups — made from polylactic acid, or PLA — are labeled as biodegradable, which is technically true. But PLA breaks down only in industrial composting centers. So without the infrastructure to collect and compost, biodegradability alone may not be as beneficial as it seems.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eNor can one replace all plastics with biodegradable ones. For some applications, such as PVC pipes or bulletproof vests, the last thing you want is for the material to break down. The key is to develop the right material for the right application, and that adds yet other challenges. For example, the temperature needed to mold, shape and process biodegradable plastics is often near the temperature under which it degrades. “The chemical linkages that make them biodegradable also makes them hard to process,” Frank says. “That’s the conundrum.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/sustainability\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eSustainability\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/sustainability/2017/pileup-plastic-debris-more-ugly-ocean-litter\\\"\u003eThe pileup of plastic debris is more than ugly ocean litter\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/sustainability\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eSustainability\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/sustainability/2019/blizzard-sustainability-labels\\\"\u003eA blizzard of “sustainability” labels\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/sustainability\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eSustainability\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/sustainability/2019/will-food-future-be-genetically-engineered-or-organic-how-about-both\\\"\u003eWill the food of the future be genetically engineered or organic?

It’s cheap, light and durable. But the reason it’s so great is also why it can be the worst. It’s so cheap that it’s discarded with nary a thought. It’s so durable that it can persist for centuries, filling landfills and \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/sustainability/2017/pileup-plastic-debris-more-ugly-ocean-litter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003espilling into the oceans\u003c/a\u003e, where it is eaten and propagates up the food chain. Plastic breaks down into bits of microplastic that fill bird and fish stomachs, causing them to starve, and sops up toxic pollutants, which can poison wildlife when ingested.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we can and should use much less plastic, we probably can’t forego it altogether. Plastic packaging, for example, keeps food fresh — crucial for feeding the world. So researchers and companies have been developing \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-061312-103323\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ebiodegradable versions of the material\u003c/a\u003e. They’re producing these materials from plants and — in pushing toward a future when everything is recycled and nothing is wasted — even food scraps and sewage. Unlike traditional plastics, which retain their chemical structure even when they break down into smaller pieces, these biodegradable plastics decompose into molecules that can safely reintegrate into the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Synthetic plastics break down like rocks — they get smaller and smaller,” says Taylor Weiss, a biophysicist at Arizona State University. “Biodegradable plastics break down like wood.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut not all biodegradable plastics are created equal, and much of the challenge is to design, or identify, the right material for the job.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eBetter Plastics\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMany environmentally friendlier plastics are already in the market, including plastic cups and bottles made from plants. Compared with traditional, petroleum-based plastics, these bioplastics are an improvement. They have a smaller carbon footprint — they don’t release extra carbon that’s been locked up in fossil fuels — and are based on renewable resources. But just because something is made from plants doesn’t mean it’s biodegradable: Some bioplastics aren’t, while some petroleum-based plastics are, says Ramani Narayan, a chemical engineer at Michigan State University.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePlastics consist of long molecular chains called polymers, made up of repeating subunits strung together. Whether they’re biodegradable depends on the strength of this chain. For common plastics like the polyethylene and polypropylene used in bags and bottles, or the polystyrene that’s commonly known as Styrofoam, the links of the chain are particularly strong.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s like a string of pearls,” says Curt Frank, a chemical engineer at Stanford University. “These pearls are connected by carbon-carbon bonds, and those carbon bonds are very strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe links in biodegradable plastics are weaker, often involving chemical groups called esters, for example. Water, acids and enzymes — including those produced by certain microbes — can break those ester links, eventually leaving compounds such as carbon dioxide and water, which can be consumed by nature, and methane, which can be captured as fuel or fed to microbes.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut biodegradability in itself isn’t necessarily meaningful, Narayan says. (“Human feces is biodegradable,” he says. “That doesn’t allow you to throw it anywhere.”) Different materials biodegrade under different conditions, and if those conditions aren’t available, then the material can be just as bad as regular plastic. For example, those increasingly familiar corn-based cups — made from polylactic acid, or PLA — are labeled as biodegradable, which is technically true. But PLA breaks down only in industrial composting centers. So without the infrastructure to collect and compost, biodegradability alone may not be as beneficial as it seems.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eNor can one replace all plastics with biodegradable ones. For some applications, such as PVC pipes or bulletproof vests, the last thing you want is for the material to break down. The key is to develop the right material for the right application, and that adds yet other challenges. For example, the temperature needed to mold, shape and process biodegradable plastics is often near the temperature under which it degrades. “The chemical linkages that make them biodegradable also makes them hard to process,” Frank says. “That’s the conundrum.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo raise the degradation temperature, for instance, researchers can add chemicals that prevent or impede the polymer chain from breaking down.

Most of the ostensibly biodegradable plastics on the market today — typically PLA — are made from food crops such as corn, potato and sugarcane. Microbes munch on sugars derived from these crops and produce lactic acid, the building block of PLA.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is potentially a great approach, Narayan says, provided that the underlying agricultural practices are sustainable. The infrastructure already exists, rural agrarian economies could benefit and, according to his calculations, just 1 percent of the globe’s total arable land could grow enough crops to meet the world’s plastic production as it was in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eStill, critics are concerned about competition with food supplies: Ethanol fuel produced from corn already has been blamed for \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/423385/ethanol-blamed-for-record-food-prices/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003edriving up food prices\u003c/a\u003e.

With its sheets rolled up into straw-like nanotubes, graphene was built into items like hockey sticks and baseball bats in the hopes that its strength and durability could better existing carbon fiber. But Krauss notes that there has since been a trend away from using nanotubes in consumer products. (Some also worry that long carbon nanotubes could harm the lungs since they have been shown to have some chemical resemblance to asbestos.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eToday graphene is finding its way into different types of products. “Graphene is here,” says Mark Hersam of Northwestern University. Layered over zinc, graphene oxide is actively being developed as a replacement, with higher storage capacity, for the sometimes unreliable graphite now used in battery anodes. And nanotubes were recently used as transistors to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1493-8?utm_source=commission_junction\u0026amp;utm_medium=affiliate\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ebuild a microprocessor\u003c/a\u003e, replacing silicon (unlike flat graphene, nanotubes can be coaxed into acting like a semiconductor). Though the microprocessor was primitive by modern computing standards, akin to the processing level of a Sega Genesis, materials scientists think it could ultimately pave the way for more efficient, faster and smaller carbon components for computer processors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, a new generation of two-dimensional materials is emerging. The success of graphene further fueled the ongoing effort to find useful atomically thin materials, working with a range of different chemicals, so as to exploit the physical properties that emerge in such super-thin substances. The newcomers include an insulator more efficient than conventional ones at stopping the movement of electrons, and another that allows electrons to glide across it at a good percent of the speed of light, with little friction. Researchers think some of these may one day replace silicon in computer chips, among other potential uses.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOther materials now in development have even higher aspirations, such as advancing scientists toward one of the most tantalizing goals in chemistry — the creation of high-temperature superconductors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eSpeedy electrons\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn graphene, carbon atoms link up in an orderly honeycomb pattern, each atom sharing electrons with three neighboring carbon atoms.

Peeling off an atom-thin layer of this black phosphorus with sticky tape produces a material called phosphorene. First fabricated in 2014, phosphorene rivals graphene in terms of strength and ability to efficiently move electrons. But at the atomic level, it isn’t as perfectly flat as graphene — and that has intriguing consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"pull-quote -right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePhosphorene interacts with electrons and photons in quirky ways, pointing to potential uses in future computer chips and fiber optics. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn graphene, carbon atoms lie side by side, hence its flatness. But phosphorene’s 2D configuration looks a bit like a pleat, with two atoms at a lower level connected to two at a higher level, forming what’s called a bandgap. This wavy structure, in turn, affects the flow of electrons in a way that makes phosphorene a “semiconductor,” meaning that it’s very easy to switch the flow of electrons on or off. Phosphorene, like silicon, could find application in computer chips, where the toggled electrons represent 1s or 0s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePhosphorene also is especially good at emitting or absorbing photons at infrared wavelengths. This optical trick gives phosphorene huge potential for use in fiber-optic communication, Hersam says, because the bandgap matches the energy of infrared light near-exactly. It could also prove very useful in solar cells.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWorking with phosphorene is not easy, however. It is highly unstable and rapidly oxidizes unless stored correctly. “Literally, it will decompose if it is sitting out in the room,” Hight Walker says, typically in less than a minute. Layering it with other 2D materials could help protect the fragile chemical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTwo sides of boron\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBoron would seem an odd fit for electronic applications. It’s better known as a fertilizer, an ingredient in fiberglass or (combined with salt) a laundry-detergent additive. But make it very thin and very flat, and boron begins to act more like a metal, conducting electricity easily. Two-dimensional boron, called borophene, is also ultra-flexible and transparent. Combined with its conductive properties, borophene’s flexibility and transparency could eventually make it a go-to material for new gadgets, including ultra-thin, foldable touch screens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLike graphene, borophene’s structure allows electrons to fly through it. It’s such a good conductor that it’s now being studied as a way to boost energy storage in lithium-ion batteries. Some researchers even think it might be coaxed into superconducting states at relatively high temperatures — though that’s still very cold (initial tests show the effect between minus-415 to minus-425 degrees Fahrenheit). Most current superconductors work close to absolute zero, or nearly minus -460 degrees F. A superconducting material allows electrons to move through it without any resistance, creating the potential for a device that accomplishes robust electronic feats while using only a small amount of power.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"The atomic structure of three emerging 2D materials are shown, including black phosphorus, boron nitride and borophene, from two different perspectives.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/378/G-2d-materials-structures.svg\\\" title=\\\"2d materials\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003eEmerging 2D materials phosphorene, borophene and boron nitride form thin films.

Yet, as part of a 2D-film of boron nitride, it can block the flow of electrons quite effectively. “In other words, 2D boron and [2D] boron nitride are on opposite ends of the electrical conductivity spectrum,” Hersam says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBoron nitride’s insulative property has come in handy for research on other 2D materials. Take that ephemeral black phosphorus: One way scientists have managed to keep it stable enough to study is by sandwiching it between two sheets of boron nitride.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEven as it is blocking electrons, however, boron nitride will allow photons to pass, says physicist Milos Toth of the University of Technology Sydney, who coauthored an article about the potential of boron nitride, and other 2D materials, in the 2019 \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-physchem-042018-052628\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Physical Chemistry\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. That’s ideal for creating things called single-photon sources, which can emit a single particle of light at a time and are used in quantum computing, quantum information processing and physics experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eMagnetic material\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother atomically thin material creating quite a buzz in materials science circles is a compound of chromium and iodine called chromium triiodide. It’s the first 2D material that naturally generates a magnetic field. Scientists working on chromium triiodide propose the material could eventually find uses in computer memory and storage, as well as in more research-focused purposes such as controlling how an electron spins.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a hitch, Hersam says: “This material is extremely hard to work with,” because it is both tough to synthesize and unstable once it’s made. Right now the only way to work with it is at extremely low temperatures, at minus-375 degrees Fahrenheit and below. But boron nitride might again come to the rescue: Some chromium triiodide samples have been preserved for months on end inside boron nitride sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of its finicky properties, chromium triiodide may not itself end up built into devices, Hight Walker says. “But when we understand the physics of what’s happening, we can go look for this 2D magnetic behavior in other materials.” A number of 2D magnetic materials are now being explored — single-layer manganese crystals woven into an insulating material is one possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eThin sandwiches\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWrangling any of these thin layers into something usable may ultimately depend — literally — on how they stack up. Different super-thin materials would be layered together so that the properties inherent in each material can complement one another. “We have insulators, semiconductors, metals and now magnets,” Hight Walker says. “Those are the pieces that you need to make almost anything you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne potential application especially exciting to Hight Walker is in quantum computing. Unlike traditional computing, in which bits of information are either ones or zeroes, quantum computing allows each “qubit” of information to be both one and zero at once. In principle, this would allow quantum computers to quickly solve problems that would take an impossibly long time with conventional machines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, though, most qubits are made of superconductors that have to be kept freezing cold, limiting their real-world use and motivating the search for new types of superconducting materials. For this reason, researchers are eager to explore borophene’s ability to superconduct.

After a few false starts, that promise is close to realization. And a suite of other extremely thin substances is following in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGraphene got its beginnings in 2003, when scientists at the University of Manchester found they could peel off a gossamer film of the material just by touching a piece of ordinary sticky tape to a block of purified graphite — the solid form of carbon that’s mixed with clay and used as the “lead” in most pencils. Graphene proved stronger than steel but extremely flexible, and electrons could zip through it at high speeds. It earned its discoverers the Nobel Prize in 2010, but researchers spent years struggling to manufacture it on larger scales and figuring out how its remarkable properties could best be used.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t get it right straight out of the gate, says Todd Krauss, a chemist at the University of Rochester. “Scientists are pretty bad at predicting what’s going to be useful in applications,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWith its atom-thin sheets layered into tiny particles known as quantum dots, graphene was tried as a microscopic medical sensor, but it didn’t perform as desired, Krauss says. With its sheets rolled up into straw-like nanotubes, graphene was built into items like hockey sticks and baseball bats in the hopes that its strength and durability could better existing carbon fiber. But Krauss notes that there has since been a trend away from using nanotubes in consumer products. (Some also worry that long carbon nanotubes could harm the lungs since they have been shown to have some chemical resemblance to asbestos.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eToday graphene is finding its way into different types of products. “Graphene is here,” says Mark Hersam of Northwestern University. Layered over zinc, graphene oxide is actively being developed as a replacement, with higher storage capacity, for the sometimes unreliable graphite now used in battery anodes. And nanotubes were recently used as transistors to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1493-8?utm_source=commission_junction\u0026amp;utm_medium=affiliate\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ebuild a microprocessor\u003c/a\u003e, replacing silicon (unlike flat graphene, nanotubes can be coaxed into acting like a semiconductor). Though the microprocessor was primitive by modern computing standards, akin to the processing level of a Sega Genesis, materials scientists think it could ultimately pave the way for more efficient, faster and smaller carbon components for computer processors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, a new generation of two-dimensional materials is emerging. The success of graphene further fueled the ongoing effort to find useful atomically thin materials, working with a range of different chemicals, so as to exploit the physical properties that emerge in such super-thin substances. The newcomers include an insulator more efficient than conventional ones at stopping the movement of electrons, and another that allows electrons to glide across it at a good percent of the speed of light, with little friction. Researchers think some of these may one day replace silicon in computer chips, among other potential uses.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOther materials now in development have even higher aspirations, such as advancing scientists toward one of the most tantalizing goals in chemistry — the creation of high-temperature superconductors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eSpeedy electrons\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn graphene, carbon atoms link up in an orderly honeycomb pattern, each atom sharing electrons with three neighboring carbon atoms. That structure allows any added electrons to move speedily across its surface. Ordinarily, a single electron might move through a conducting metal like copper at 1.2 inches per minute (given a 12-gauge wire with 10 amps of electricity). But in early experiments on graphene, electrons zipped along at \u003ca href=\\\"https://physicsworld.com/a/electrons-lose-their-mass-in-carbon-sheets/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e2.34 billion inches\u003c/a\u003e per minute — which could make for electronics that charge in \u003ca href=\\\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-battery-material-with-5x-faster-charging-speed\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e just a few minutes \u003c/a\u003e and eventually in a \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aenm.201702895\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e matter of seconds\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGraphene conducts heat just as well as it conducts electricity. It’s also one of the strongest materials ever studied — stronger than steel, it can stop a bullet — but oddly stretchy too, meaning it’s both flexible and tough.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOther 2D materials under exploration may have similar attributes as well as novel qualities all their own, but chemical impurities have until recently kept them hidden, says Angela Hight Walker, a project leader at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland. “We’re now getting to the point where we can see the new physics that’s been covered up by poor sample quality,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the newcomers is \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-physchem-050317-021353\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eblack phosphorus\u003c/a\u003e, explored by Hersam and his coauthor Vinod Sangwan in the 2018 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Physical Chemistry\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eWhen white phosphorus — a caustic, highly reactive chemical — is super-heated under high pressure, it becomes a flaky, conductive material with graphite-like behavior. Peeling off an atom-thin layer of this black phosphorus with sticky tape produces a material called phosphorene. First fabricated in 2014, phosphorene rivals graphene in terms of strength and ability to efficiently move electrons. But at the atomic level, it isn’t as perfectly flat as graphene — and that has intriguing consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"pull-quote -right\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePhosphorene interacts with electrons and photons in quirky ways, pointing to potential uses in future computer chips and fiber optics. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn graphene, carbon atoms lie side by side, hence its flatness. But phosphorene’s 2D configuration looks a bit like a pleat, with two atoms at a lower level connected to two at a higher level, forming what’s called a bandgap. This wavy structure, in turn, affects the flow of electrons in a way that makes phosphorene a “semiconductor,” meaning that it’s very easy to switch the flow of electrons on or off. Phosphorene, like silicon, could find application in computer chips, where the toggled electrons represent 1s or 0s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePhosphorene also is especially good at emitting or absorbing photons at infrared wavelengths. This optical trick gives phosphorene huge potential for use in fiber-optic communication, Hersam says, because the bandgap matches the energy of infrared light near-exactly. It could also prove very useful in solar cells.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWorking with phosphorene is not easy, however. It is highly unstable and rapidly oxidizes unless stored correctly. “Literally, it will decompose if it is sitting out in the room,” Hight Walker says, typically in less than a minute. Layering it with other 2D materials could help protect the fragile chemical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTwo sides of boron\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBoron would seem an odd fit for electronic applications. It’s better known as a fertilizer, an ingredient in fiberglass or (combined with salt) a laundry-detergent additive. But make it very thin and very flat, and boron begins to act more like a metal, conducting electricity easily. Two-dimensional boron, called borophene, is also ultra-flexible and transparent. Combined with its conductive properties, borophene’s flexibility and transparency could eventually make it a go-to material for new gadgets, including ultra-thin, foldable touch screens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLike graphene, borophene’s structure allows electrons to fly through it. It’s such a good conductor that it’s now being studied as a way to boost energy storage in lithium-ion batteries. Some researchers even think it might be coaxed into superconducting states at relatively high temperatures — though that’s still very cold (initial tests show the effect between minus-415 to minus-425 degrees Fahrenheit). Most current superconductors work close to absolute zero, or nearly minus -460 degrees F. A superconducting material allows electrons to move through it without any resistance, creating the potential for a device that accomplishes robust electronic feats while using only a small amount of power.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the form of borophene, boron can conduct electrons like a metal. Yet, as part of a 2D-film of boron nitride, it can block the flow of electrons quite effectively. “In other words, 2D boron and [2D] boron nitride are on opposite ends of the electrical conductivity spectrum,” Hersam says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBoron nitride’s insulative property has come in handy for research on other 2D materials. Take that ephemeral black phosphorus: One way scientists have managed to keep it stable enough to study is by sandwiching it between two sheets of boron nitride.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEven as it is blocking electrons, however, boron nitride will allow photons to pass, says physicist Milos Toth of the University of Technology Sydney, who coauthored an article about the potential of boron nitride, and other 2D materials, in the 2019 \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-physchem-042018-052628\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Physical Chemistry\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. That’s ideal for creating things called single-photon sources, which can emit a single particle of light at a time and are used in quantum computing, quantum information processing and physics experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eMagnetic material\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother atomically thin material creating quite a buzz in materials science circles is a compound of chromium and iodine called chromium triiodide. It’s the first 2D material that naturally generates a magnetic field. Scientists working on chromium triiodide propose the material could eventually find uses in computer memory and storage, as well as in more research-focused purposes such as controlling how an electron spins.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a hitch, Hersam says: “This material is extremely hard to work with,” because it is both tough to synthesize and unstable once it’s made. Right now the only way to work with it is at extremely low temperatures, at minus-375 degrees Fahrenheit and below. But boron nitride might again come to the rescue: Some chromium triiodide samples have been preserved for months on end inside boron nitride sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of its finicky properties, chromium triiodide may not itself end up built into devices, Hight Walker says. “But when we understand the physics of what’s happening, we can go look for this 2D magnetic behavior in other materials.” A number of 2D magnetic materials are now being explored — single-layer manganese crystals woven into an insulating material is one possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eThin sandwiches\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWrangling any of these thin layers into something usable may ultimately depend — literally — on how they stack up. Different super-thin materials would be layered together so that the properties inherent in each material can complement one another. “We have insulators, semiconductors, metals and now magnets,” Hight Walker says. “Those are the pieces that you need to make almost anything you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne potential application especially exciting to Hight Walker is in quantum computing. Unlike traditional computing, in which bits of information are either ones or zeroes, quantum computing allows each “qubit” of information to be both one and zero at once. In principle, this would allow quantum computers to quickly solve problems that would take an impossibly long time with conventional machines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, though, most qubits are made of superconductors that have to be kept freezing cold, limiting their real-world use and motivating the search for new types of superconducting materials. For this reason, researchers are eager to explore borophene’s ability to superconduct. (Graphene, layered a certain way, also has shown potential superconducting properties.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut a stacked material involving several superconducting layers separated by strong insulators could enable smaller, more stable qubits that don’t require quite as low temperatures — which could reduce the overall size of quantum computers. Right now, these are room-sized affairs, much like early computers were.

Such mobile hybrids could also manipulate cellular interactions or generate heat to induce other medically beneficial effects.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAll hybrid bot approaches have in common the idea of combining a mobile microbe — one that can crawl or swim — with a structure that can carry cargo such as drugs or do other jobs. But unlike Daleks, which all look pretty much alike, hybrid microrobots can be built from a diverse repertoire of mobile microorganisms. Researchers have also engineered a library of artificial carriers made from different materials, with different sizes and shapes, that can hook up with the microorganisms without killing them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSuch diversity is necessary because no one type of microbot would be suitable for all purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no single recipe for developing the ideal biohybrid microrobot, since the required performance and functionality are highly dependent on the specific application,” write Alapan and coauthors, from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers have investigated various designs and fabrication methods for attaching microbes to a cargo carrier. In one approach, natural electric charges can bind the two electrostatically; the bacterium \u003cem\u003eSerratia marcescens\u003c/em\u003e, for instance, carries a positive charge enabling it to bond to a carrier made from negatively charged polystyrene plastic particles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases a single cargo-carrying structure is propelled by multiple microbes; in other instances one or two microbes alone can drive the drug-delivery microtruck.

Researchers are exploring the use of multiple different microbes for propulsion and various types of cargo-carrying structures; success requires finding effective methods for integrating the microbe with the carrier and effective methods of steering the hybrid bot, such as with magnetic fields, light pulses or chemical signals in the bot’s environment.\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAll such designs exploit the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria or algae, to swim or crawl through biological environments. These microbes self-propel by consuming chemical energy from their surroundings to drive “molecular motors.” Bacteria swim toward food, for instance, by way of molecular machinery that rotates propeller-like protrusions known as flagella. A different form of flagellar motion drives sperm on their quest to fertilize eggs. Other microorganisms travel using amoeboid movement, driven by flexing of their cellular skeletons, built from the protein actin. As its skeleton flexes, protrusions from a cell’s membrane latch on to surrounding surfaces to pull itself forward.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMobile microbes are ideal for bot propulsion for several reasons. They can move rapidly through the body, have the ability to interact with the body’s cells, and are small enough to work their way through the body’s smallest passageways, such as capillaries in the circulatory system. A deformable microbot made from \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e attached to red blood cells that have been evacuated and loaded with cargo can squeeze through passages smaller than the bot itself, one study has shown.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Such advantages make biohybrid cellular microrobots attractive candidates for medical applications, including targeted drug delivery,” Alapan and colleagues write.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a daily-life perspective, bot propulsion might seem slow. \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e’s swimming speed through water is about half a mile per year (and perhaps not that fast in biological fluids). Some white blood cells crawl at more like a mile per century. But within their own microscopic Olympics, such speeds are impressive. \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e can traverse 15 times its own body length per second, the equivalent of a human running the 100-meter dash in a little over three seconds, making Usain Bolt look like a turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSpeed is not the only issue, though. Accurate steering is also essential.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers in recent years have reported rapid progress in developing effective steering strategies. A 2017 study showed success in coating spirulina, a type of cyanobacteria, with magnetic nanoparticles and then guiding it through a rat’s stomach by applying an external magnetic field. Other research has shown that white blood cells loaded with magnetic nanoparticles can be steered toward a tumor to deliver drugs. Another study showed that algae-based microbots can be guided by LED light pulses.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn some bot designs, steering relies on the microbe’s own ability to sense the chemistry of its environment. “An attractive aspect of chemical control is the availability of a wide variety of chemical signals released locally by targeted cells or tissues,” Alapan and collaborators note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhile offering many desirable features, hybrid microrobots pose formidable problems. Medical and engineering considerations must merge in a way that make the bots both reliable and safe. Cargo-carrying structures must be made of materials that do not trigger attacks from the body’s immune system, for example. For that matter, the carriers must also not be toxic to the microbes that propel them. And somehow the carriers must be disposed of safely after their job is finished. (One approach is loading the microrobot with sensors that can be activated by infrared light to generate enough heat to degrade the bot on command.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, it’s unlikely that any medical intervention could be successfully accomplished with a single hybrid microbot. So techniques must be devised to control and coordinate the movement and actions of entire swarms of bots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“The use of biohybrid microrobots in medicine still presents many challenges,” Alapan and coauthors write. Designing research to meet those challenges in “close collaboration with medical researchers … would significantly enhance and accelerate the translation of biohybrid microrobots for medical use.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\",\"field_all_authors\":\"  \u003cp class=\\\"article-byline\\\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\\\"author-byline\\\"\u003eBy Tom\u0026nbsp;Siegfried \u003c/span\u003e 09.12.2019\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\",\"field_author_bios\":\"  \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom Siegfried\u003c/b\u003e is a science writer and editor in the Washington, DC, area.

These “hybrid biological microrobots” could deliver disease-fighting drugs, attack tumors or perform other helpful functions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctors will not be deploying hybrid microrobot armies into anybody’s body anytime soon. Researchers will need to circumvent numerous technical obstacles before microbots become standard operating procedure. But neither is the prospect entirely hypothetical.

Such mobile hybrids could also manipulate cellular interactions or generate heat to induce other medically beneficial effects.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAll hybrid bot approaches have in common the idea of combining a mobile microbe — one that can crawl or swim — with a structure that can carry cargo such as drugs or do other jobs. But unlike Daleks, which all look pretty much alike, hybrid microrobots can be built from a diverse repertoire of mobile microorganisms. Researchers have also engineered a library of artificial carriers made from different materials, with different sizes and shapes, that can hook up with the microorganisms without killing them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSuch diversity is necessary because no one type of microbot would be suitable for all purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no single recipe for developing the ideal biohybrid microrobot, since the required performance and functionality are highly dependent on the specific application,” write Alapan and coauthors, from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers have investigated various designs and fabrication methods for attaching microbes to a cargo carrier. In one approach, natural electric charges can bind the two electrostatically; the bacterium \u003cem\u003eSerratia marcescens\u003c/em\u003e, for instance, carries a positive charge enabling it to bond to a carrier made from negatively charged polystyrene plastic particles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases a single cargo-carrying structure is propelled by multiple microbes; in other instances one or two microbes alone can drive the drug-delivery microtruck. And in the more Dalek-like design, the microbe is entrapped inside the cargo-carrying structure.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAll such designs exploit the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria or algae, to swim or crawl through biological environments. These microbes self-propel by consuming chemical energy from their surroundings to drive “molecular motors.” Bacteria swim toward food, for instance, by way of molecular machinery that rotates propeller-like protrusions known as flagella. A different form of flagellar motion drives sperm on their quest to fertilize eggs. Other microorganisms travel using amoeboid movement, driven by flexing of their cellular skeletons, built from the protein actin. As its skeleton flexes, protrusions from a cell’s membrane latch on to surrounding surfaces to pull itself forward.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMobile microbes are ideal for bot propulsion for several reasons. They can move rapidly through the body, have the ability to interact with the body’s cells, and are small enough to work their way through the body’s smallest passageways, such as capillaries in the circulatory system. A deformable microbot made from \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e attached to red blood cells that have been evacuated and loaded with cargo can squeeze through passages smaller than the bot itself, one study has shown.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Such advantages make biohybrid cellular microrobots attractive candidates for medical applications, including targeted drug delivery,” Alapan and colleagues write.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a daily-life perspective, bot propulsion might seem slow. \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e’s swimming speed through water is about half a mile per year (and perhaps not that fast in biological fluids). Some white blood cells crawl at more like a mile per century. But within their own microscopic Olympics, such speeds are impressive. \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e can traverse 15 times its own body length per second, the equivalent of a human running the 100-meter dash in a little over three seconds, making Usain Bolt look like a turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSpeed is not the only issue, though. Accurate steering is also essential.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers in recent years have reported rapid progress in developing effective steering strategies. A 2017 study showed success in coating spirulina, a type of cyanobacteria, with magnetic nanoparticles and then guiding it through a rat’s stomach by applying an external magnetic field. Other research has shown that white blood cells loaded with magnetic nanoparticles can be steered toward a tumor to deliver drugs. Another study showed that algae-based microbots can be guided by LED light pulses.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn some bot designs, steering relies on the microbe’s own ability to sense the chemistry of its environment. “An attractive aspect of chemical control is the availability of a wide variety of chemical signals released locally by targeted cells or tissues,” Alapan and collaborators note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhile offering many desirable features, hybrid microrobots pose formidable problems. Medical and engineering considerations must merge in a way that make the bots both reliable and safe. Cargo-carrying structures must be made of materials that do not trigger attacks from the body’s immune system, for example. For that matter, the carriers must also not be toxic to the microbes that propel them. And somehow the carriers must be disposed of safely after their job is finished. (One approach is loading the microrobot with sensors that can be activated by infrared light to generate enough heat to degrade the bot on command.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, it’s unlikely that any medical intervention could be successfully accomplished with a single hybrid microbot. So techniques must be devised to control and coordinate the movement and actions of entire swarms of bots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“The use of biohybrid microrobots in medicine still presents many challenges,” Alapan and coauthors write. Designing research to meet those challenges in “close collaboration with medical researchers … would significantly enhance and accelerate the translation of biohybrid microrobots for medical use.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-091119-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom Siegfried\u003c/b\u003e is a science writer and editor in the Washington, DC, area.

Images generated from these data include NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) maps, which have long been created using satellites and airplanes by calculating the ratio of the difference of near-infrared and visible light radiation. Newer sensors take advantage of additional wavelengths in the light spectrum and may add filters and other resolution-enhancing tricks.

It is very common, and it takes a serious toll.

When institutions upholding the rule of law are absent or weak, offering very little protection, revenge can serve an important function. In such a context, people who are expected to seek revenge if they are harmed will often manage to ward off aggression. So it really serves a function there.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou mention that the Bible pivoted on the subject of revenge between the Old and New Testaments, moving from “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” to “turning the other cheek.” How might this be explained by the times and places in which each text was written?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eArguably, the New Testament was written during a period when we had larger states, more stability and social organization, and where revenge would therefore have been less valuable compared to the days of the Old Testament. But we would need to test this more directly.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven the “New” Testament was written a long time ago. Yet we are still struggling to suppress people’s urge to take revenge. Does your research point to new ways of doing so?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eStrengthening institutions certainly helps — for example, by improving people’s trust in the police or the legal system. When you can outsource these kinds of punishments and believe that they will be fair and just, revenge becomes less attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOn an individual level, empathy and perspective-taking are important. If we understand our own biases and our own contribution to a conflict, forgiveness is more likely.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, I think we should help people understand how to manage conflicts, in the same way that we teach mathematics and physics and biology in schools today.

The classic idiom “revenge is sweet” does have some empirical support — neuroscience research shows that \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5688/1254.long\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ereward centers in the brain are activated when people are just thinking about taking revenge\u003c/a\u003e, and people forecast that they are going to be happy after seeking revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut other research shows that this is short-lived, and that people are often not as happy as they thought they would be. In that sense, revenge can be thought of as \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116302554\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ebittersweet\u003c/a\u003e, involving positive and negative feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you remember a time when revenge felt very satisfying to you personally?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, I can’t say I have any particular stories.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerhaps even if you had, you might have been apprehensive to discuss it. Though revenge is the driver behind many famous stories and movies, it is not something we tend to be proud of.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI think that is largely true in the US and some other Western countries, but I wonder whether it is universal. In contexts where revenge serves a function in managing one’s reputation, people might be more willing to talk about these stories, and they might be a source of pride instead of embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be an interesting hypothesis to test. There is certainly some universality to revenge, but there is also a tremendous amount of cultural variation. In some cultures, seeking revenge is seen as absolutely necessary to restore one’s reputation. The importance of honor is instantiated in many ancient proverbs, such as the Arabic “dignity before bread.” \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2008.00182.x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eGiven its importance, people are often willing to fight to restore their honor.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrikingly, this might even extend to taking revenge on people who were not involved before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Probably the most interesting thing we have learned is how contagious revenge can become, across people and time. One of the things we consider to be really fundamental to this is what we call entitativity, which is really just how interchangeable people are believed to be. For example, \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208322999\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eif you and I are entitative, and someone harms you, that feels as if it was harm to myself\u003c/a\u003e, and motivates me for revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOutgroup members can be perceived as interchangeable as well. If someone who harmed you is related to another person, I could seek revenge on this person I have never had any contact with. This way, conflicts can escalate from the individual to the group level, even across generations, all because of this perception of entitativity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow might this insight help us to break the cycles of violence between groups?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the ways in which people try to reduce these issues is by broadening the group identity, promoting a national identity instead of a tribal one. A key issue, however, is that we shouldn’t just operate on the idea of identity. A shift in perspective should be accompanied by measures to end discrimination and promote a fair allocation of power and resources between groups as well.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNational identities can help to bring people together on a national level, but that might equally stimulate conflicts between different “nations.” Could there be a way to promote such a shared identity for humanity as a whole, even in the absence of an extraterrestrial common enemy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I do believe a global identity — perhaps engendered by collective threats such as climate change — has the power to unite humans to achieve unprecedented levels of cooperation.

She’s especially intrigued by the psychological desire to retaliate — and the fact that this urge is so often contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003ePeople not involved in the original conflict may sometimes feel like taking revenge for the harm done to others in their group. They might even take it out on relatives of the perpetrator or others perceived as belonging to the same group, even if those people hold no responsibility whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGelfand, now at the University of Maryland, tackles the topic with a range of research tools, from brain imaging in the lab to fieldwork in the Middle East. In an article in the 2019 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Psychology\u003c/em\u003e, she and her colleagues explain \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103305\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewhat revenge research has taught us so far\u003c/a\u003e. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a fascinating subject, yet it seems difficult to study. How do you go about it? Do you seek out people who already feel like taking revenge, or do you get them to feel that way?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs a social scientist, I’ve always been a proponent of having multiple methods to study anything, as every method has its strengths and limitations. You can manipulate contexts where people in the laboratory feel like they have been intentionally harmed. You can also conduct surveys to ask people about times they’ve felt they’ve been harmed in the past, and study their reactions and their emotions in those contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in some recent work that we’ve published on honor cultures — where there is a willingness to retaliate against people to defend one’s reputation even if doing so is very risky or costly — we have even used computational models, to try and simulate the circumstances under which revenge might turn out to be beneficial. These simulations suggest that unreliable institutions and a generally tough environment \u003ca href=\\\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f5f7/99eccaa35ea47a2d2ba63c85b631d70d7db4.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003emay be crucial conditions for the evolution of honor cultures\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn your review, you write that “revenge has not received much attention in the history of intellectual thought.” Why do you think this subject has been largely ignored for so long?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s interesting, because revenge — which we define as motivated retaliation after one perceives harm to one’s well-being — is a universal phenomenon. It is very common, and it takes a serious toll. In the US, for example, desire for revenge has been implicated in over 60 percent of school shootings and over a quarter of bombings.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be that early philosophers were more focused on virtue, considering revenge to be a very negative phenomenon. Only recently have researchers started to theorize that the urge to retaliate might reflect something really fundamental about human psychology, with both positive and negative aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen revenge is studied, it is often treated as something to be avoided or prevented. Yet you and your coauthors stress that “vengeance can be functional and even necessary.” Really?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and there are a number of different reasons for that. From an individual perspective, revenge has long been thought to be a deterrent, a way to signal to others that one is strong and not to be messed with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore recently, the focus has shifted to cultural processes, suggesting that revenge also reflects how groups operate, and helps people work together at times when cooperation is essential for group survival. By discouraging the violation of social norms, revenge may help to keep the group together.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf revenge can be useful, would you go as far as recommending it in certain situations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure I would recommend it, but we can understand why it exists, and why it may be needed. When institutions upholding the rule of law are absent or weak, offering very little protection, revenge can serve an important function. In such a context, people who are expected to seek revenge if they are harmed will often manage to ward off aggression. So it really serves a function there.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou mention that the Bible pivoted on the subject of revenge between the Old and New Testaments, moving from “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” to “turning the other cheek.” How might this be explained by the times and places in which each text was written?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eArguably, the New Testament was written during a period when we had larger states, more stability and social organization, and where revenge would therefore have been less valuable compared to the days of the Old Testament. But we would need to test this more directly.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven the “New” Testament was written a long time ago. Yet we are still struggling to suppress people’s urge to take revenge. Does your research point to new ways of doing so?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eStrengthening institutions certainly helps — for example, by improving people’s trust in the police or the legal system. When you can outsource these kinds of punishments and believe that they will be fair and just, revenge becomes less attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOn an individual level, empathy and perspective-taking are important. If we understand our own biases and our own contribution to a conflict, forgiveness is more likely.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, I think we should help people understand how to manage conflicts, in the same way that we teach mathematics and physics and biology in schools today. Negotiation and conflict management should be a required course.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShould the old adage that “revenge is a dish best served cold” be taught in classrooms? Is it advisable to let things cool down before you do something you might regret later?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI think that’s right. People often seek revenge when they are angry, which may reduce their self-control. Revenge often involves risk, which people have a natural aversion to, and anger is one of the strongest factors that can overcome this aversion.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when people get more psychological distance from what happened, that might reduce the anger and the revenge instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnother thing we might teach is that research shows that personal gain is rare and feelings of regret may soon set in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed. The classic idiom “revenge is sweet” does have some empirical support — neuroscience research shows that \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5688/1254.long\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ereward centers in the brain are activated when people are just thinking about taking revenge\u003c/a\u003e, and people forecast that they are going to be happy after seeking revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut other research shows that this is short-lived, and that people are often not as happy as they thought they would be. In that sense, revenge can be thought of as \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116302554\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ebittersweet\u003c/a\u003e, involving positive and negative feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you remember a time when revenge felt very satisfying to you personally?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, I can’t say I have any particular stories.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerhaps even if you had, you might have been apprehensive to discuss it. Though revenge is the driver behind many famous stories and movies, it is not something we tend to be proud of.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI think that is largely true in the US and some other Western countries, but I wonder whether it is universal. In contexts where revenge serves a function in managing one’s reputation, people might be more willing to talk about these stories, and they might be a source of pride instead of embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be an interesting hypothesis to test. There is certainly some universality to revenge, but there is also a tremendous amount of cultural variation. In some cultures, seeking revenge is seen as absolutely necessary to restore one’s reputation. The importance of honor is instantiated in many ancient proverbs, such as the Arabic “dignity before bread.” \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2008.00182.x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eGiven its importance, people are often willing to fight to restore their honor.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrikingly, this might even extend to taking revenge on people who were not involved before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Probably the most interesting thing we have learned is how contagious revenge can become, across people and time. One of the things we consider to be really fundamental to this is what we call entitativity, which is really just how interchangeable people are believed to be. For example, \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208322999\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eif you and I are entitative, and someone harms you, that feels as if it was harm to myself\u003c/a\u003e, and motivates me for revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOutgroup members can be perceived as interchangeable as well. If someone who harmed you is related to another person, I could seek revenge on this person I have never had any contact with. This way, conflicts can escalate from the individual to the group level, even across generations, all because of this perception of entitativity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow might this insight help us to break the cycles of violence between groups?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the ways in which people try to reduce these issues is by broadening the group identity, promoting a national identity instead of a tribal one. A key issue, however, is that we shouldn’t just operate on the idea of identity. A shift in perspective should be accompanied by measures to end discrimination and promote a fair allocation of power and resources between groups as well.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNational identities can help to bring people together on a national level, but that might equally stimulate conflicts between different “nations.” Could there be a way to promote such a shared identity for humanity as a whole, even in the absence of an extraterrestrial common enemy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I do believe a global identity — perhaps engendered by collective threats such as climate change — has the power to unite humans to achieve unprecedented levels of cooperation. But that, of course, is a very optimistic view, and there is a lot of work left to be done before we get there.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-101619-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTim Vernimmen\u003c/b\u003e (\u003ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/timvernimmen\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e@timvernimmen\u003c/a\u003e) is a freelance science writer based near Antwerp, Belgium.

Other people have looked at differences between male and female parasitic cowbirds, because females have to find and monitor many, many nests of other species to lay their eggs in — which is a pretty heavy memory-based task. People have also looked at differences between monogamous voles and voles where males have multiple mates and bigger territories; the latter have better memory and a larger hippocampus.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCognitive ecology research was quite popular at the conference this year. Is this a field that is growing and advancing quickly right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI think so. The field initially started with comparing multiple species, and that was good in some ways, but in other ways it didn’t quite work. I think this was largely because when you’re comparing different species, there are a lot\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eof differences between them, not just cognition. And when you test them, all of these differences contribute to how they perform. For example, species react very differently to captivity. All animals have evolved to function a certain way and when you bring different species into the lab and put them all in a white room, even closely related species will respond to that room differently. This makes it hard to know which behavioral differences are due to differences in cognition.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI decided that, to solve this, you need to look at differences between populations of the same species. Once you look at the same species, at the very least it’s more similar than comparing, let’s say, jays and chickadees. So we started by comparing chickadees from Alaska to chickadees from Colorado in the lab. The idea was that in Alaska it’s really harsh in the winter, but in Colorado it’s milder and the chickadees would have to rely less on food-caching, so their memory wouldn’t need to be as good. And sure enough, \u003ca href=\\\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-17253-001\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ewe found giant differences between the two populations\u003c/a\u003e: Birds from Alaska had better memory, a larger hippocampus and more neurons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour presentation drew a standing-room-only crowd. Can you explain what had everyone so interested?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eComparative studies still don’t directly show how the cognitive differences happen. They suggest, and everybody assumes, it’s natural selection, but nobody could show it. People attempted to test birds in the lab and then release them to see how their cognitive differences affected their survival, but it didn’t work. So that kind of forced me years ago to go into the field. And part of it was building the apparatus with RFID capabilities so we could test their cognition in the wild. We can also track the chickadees’ survival, reproduction, who they mate with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Graphic shows the experimental set-up used to test the memories of mountain chickadees in the wild.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/336/G-testing-chickadee-memory.svg\\\" title=\\\"Memory test\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eScientists designed an array of eight electronic feeding stations that can be suspended between trees in the chickadees’ natural habitat. The array uses technology to identify and log each visit made by a bird. The log reveals how well each bird remembers which of the eight stations is programmed to respond to its ID tag and produce a seed. Birds with the best memory return directly to the station that opens for them. Birds with poor memory might have to visit one or more stations before landing on the right one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe work I presented at the meeting was specifically looking at juveniles in their first year to see if natural selection affects cognition. If so, we would expect to see that the birds who did better on the cognitive test, who have a better spatial memory, will be more likely to survive their first winter, and the ones that do worse will be more likely to die. And that’s what we found. We directly confirmed for the first time what everybody suspected — that yes, it looks like what’s happening is that spatial cognition is directly acted upon by natural selection.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWe also compared mountain chickadees living at higher and lower elevations in the Sierras. At higher elevation, almost 70 percent of juveniles may die during their first winter, every year. That’s a lot! That’s good, though, if you’re interested in selection. If more animals are dying and there’s some reason for some animals to survive better, well, that’s where you can best see the results of selection: Those that survive will reproduce and their offspring should be better equipped to survive harsh conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo at high elevations we already know the birds cache significantly more food than those living at lower elevations. They also show much better spatial cognition, and they have a larger hippocampus, more neurons, bigger neurons and more new neurons forming. The difference between the two populations is startling — it’s very big.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now we have also shown that mortality of juveniles is higher at high elevations. But that isn’t the case for adults at high elevation: For those that manage to survive, the mortality rate is \u003cem\u003elower\u003c/em\u003e than for adults at lower elevations, where conditions are milder. So in other words, if they have the cognitive traits to get through the tough selection at higher elevation and survive their first winter, they can live much longer. This is despite a crazy amount of snow at those elevations — we’re talking about 20 or 25 feet of snow in some years.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo the differences in cognition affect more than just survival?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eYes, we’ve also shown that females that mate with males with a better memory \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13249\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003elay bigger clutches and produce bigger broods\u003c/a\u003e. Now we’re trying to figure out why. It’s not because these males are able to provide more food for the young, because they don’t use caches for feeding young. (Both adults and young eat insects in spring.) And the males don’t seem to use their superb memory for reproduction. Their memory is so good because they need to recover all these tens of thousands of caches. As far as breeding goes, it’s overbuilt — a bit like having space technology to put butter on your sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo any individual differences in memory would be critical for survival during the winter, when finding caches is essential for survival, but not likely to make a difference during breeding, when demands on memory are much lower.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Photo shows a juvenile mountain chickadee in winter with a seed in its beak.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/336/P-mountain-chickadee-seed.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Cached seed\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA mountain chickadee grasps a seed in its beak in winter.

A big question we’re working on now is how the females know which males have better memory. It may be that they can watch the males retrieving caches. But we think a more logical potential explanation is that variation in cognition is somehow indicated by male song quality or by some other characteristic, maybe plumage.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan what you’ve learned about chickadees teach us anything about memory and cognition in general? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt can explain, I think, how memory evolves across multiple species, why some species’ memory may be better and some species’ worse, how that can change over time, and why. Going further, we’re looking at genetics as well. Currently we are collaborating with Scott Taylor at the University of Colorado Boulder on sequencing full chickadee genomes. We’ve already sequenced the genomes of 40 individuals — 20 from high elevation, 20 from low elevation. From each elevation, we selected the birds with the best and worst performances on memory tests. Now we’re trying to see what genetic differences may contribute to these memory differences.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, with our RFID apparatus, we can test spatial memory in the wild, and we can track performance over time. So hypothetically we can study things like aging and senescence, I would argue, better than anybody in the lab. Because once you get an animal in the lab, it doesn’t live a natural life, even if it’s a mouse. Mice don’t naturally live in a tiny plastic tub, they live in a much more complex environment. It’s the same with wild birds. If you bring wild birds into the lab, they may be OK, but they don’t senesce the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf we track and test the animals in the wild for their entire life, we may have a better chance to detect and study senescence. And we can test two closely related species, like let’s say our chickadees and great tits, which do not cache food and so may not need specialized spatial memory. If we were to find that for great tits the cognition starts to decline at three years, and our birds maybe at seven\u003cem\u003e — whoa.\u003c/em\u003e Then we can ask some very interesting questions about how it is that these two species age so differently and how chickadees keep their memory for so much longer. It could maybe lead to a better understanding of things like Alzheimer’s. I probably wouldn’t be able to do that part myself, but somebody might.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\",\"field_all_authors\":\"  \u003cp class=\\\"article-byline\\\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\\\"author-byline\\\"\u003eBy Betsy\u0026nbsp;Mason \u003c/span\u003e 09.05.2019\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\",\"field_author_bios\":\"  \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://betsymason.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eBetsy Mason\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e is a freelance journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area who specializes in science and cartography.

Other people have looked at differences between male and female parasitic cowbirds, because females have to find and monitor many, many nests of other species to lay their eggs in — which is a pretty heavy memory-based task. People have also looked at differences between monogamous voles and voles where males have multiple mates and bigger territories; the latter have better memory and a larger hippocampus.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCognitive ecology research was quite popular at the conference this year. Is this a field that is growing and advancing quickly right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eI think so. The field initially started with comparing multiple species, and that was good in some ways, but in other ways it didn’t quite work. I think this was largely because when you’re comparing different species, there are a lot\u003cem\u003eof differences between them, not just cognition. And when you test them, all of these differences contribute to how they perform. For example, species react very differently to captivity. All animals have evolved to function a certain way and when you bring different species into the lab and put them all in a white room, even closely related species will respond to that room differently. This makes it hard to know which behavioral differences are due to differences in cognition.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI decided that, to solve this, you need to look at differences between populations of the same species. Once you look at the same species, at the very least it’s more similar than comparing, let’s say, jays and chickadees. So we started by comparing chickadees from Alaska to chickadees from Colorado in the lab. The idea was that in Alaska it’s really harsh in the winter, but in Colorado it’s milder and the chickadees would have to rely less on food-caching, so their memory wouldn’t need to be as good. And sure enough, \u003ca href=\\\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-17253-001\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewe found giant differences between the two populations\u003c/a\u003e: Birds from Alaska had better memory, a larger hippocampus and more neurons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour presentation drew a standing-room-only crowd. Can you explain what had everyone so interested?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eComparative studies still don’t directly show how the cognitive differences happen. They suggest, and everybody assumes, it’s natural selection, but nobody could show it. People attempted to test birds in the lab and then release them to see how their cognitive differences affected their survival, but it didn’t work. So that kind of forced me years ago to go into the field. And part of it was building the apparatus with RFID capabilities so we could test their cognition in the wild. We can also track the chickadees’ survival, reproduction, who they mate with.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe work I presented at the meeting was specifically looking at juveniles in their first year to see if natural selection affects cognition. If so, we would expect to see that the birds who did better on the cognitive test, who have a better spatial memory, will be more likely to survive their first winter, and the ones that do worse will be more likely to die. And that’s what we found. We directly confirmed for the first time what everybody suspected — that yes, it looks like what’s happening is that spatial cognition is directly acted upon by natural selection.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe also compared mountain chickadees living at higher and lower elevations in the Sierras. At higher elevation, almost 70 percent of juveniles may die during their first winter, every year. That’s a lot! That’s good, though, if you’re interested in selection. If more animals are dying and there’s some reason for some animals to survive better, well, that’s where you can best see the results of selection: Those that survive will reproduce and their offspring should be better equipped to survive harsh conditions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo at high elevations we already know the birds cache significantly more food than those living at lower elevations. They also show much better spatial cognition, and they have a larger hippocampus, more neurons, bigger neurons and more new neurons forming. The difference between the two populations is startling — it’s very big.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd now we have also shown that mortality of juveniles is higher at high elevations. But that isn’t the case for adults at high elevation: For those that manage to survive, the mortality rate is \u003cem\u003elower\u003c/em\u003e than for adults at lower elevations, where conditions are milder. So in other words, if they have the cognitive traits to get through the tough selection at higher elevation and survive their first winter, they can live much longer. This is despite a crazy amount of snow at those elevations — we’re talking about 20 or 25 feet of snow in some years.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo the differences in cognition affect more than just survival?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, we’ve also shown that females that mate with males with a better memory \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13249\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003elay bigger clutches and produce bigger broods\u003c/a\u003e. Now we’re trying to figure out why. It’s not because these males are able to provide more food for the young, because they don’t use caches for feeding young. (Both adults and young eat insects in spring.) And the males don’t seem to use their superb memory for reproduction. Their memory is so good because they need to recover all these tens of thousands of caches. As far as breeding goes, it’s overbuilt — a bit like having space technology to put butter on your sandwich.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo any individual differences in memory would be critical for survival during the winter, when finding caches is essential for survival, but not likely to make a difference during breeding, when demands on memory are much lower.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe only way we can think of to explain it is as an investment for the future: Females produce more because their offspring will more likely survive, because they will have the genetics that will allow those offspring to have a better memory. A big question we’re working on now is how the females know which males have better memory. It may be that they can watch the males retrieving caches. But we think a more logical potential explanation is that variation in cognition is somehow indicated by male song quality or by some other characteristic, maybe plumage.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan what you’ve learned about chickadees teach us anything about memory and cognition in general? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt can explain, I think, how memory evolves across multiple species, why some species’ memory may be better and some species’ worse, how that can change over time, and why. Going further, we’re looking at genetics as well. Currently we are collaborating with Scott Taylor at the University of Colorado Boulder on sequencing full chickadee genomes. We’ve already sequenced the genomes of 40 individuals — 20 from high elevation, 20 from low elevation. From each elevation, we selected the birds with the best and worst performances on memory tests. Now we’re trying to see what genetic differences may contribute to these memory differences.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd now, with our RFID apparatus, we can test spatial memory in the wild, and we can track performance over time. So hypothetically we can study things like aging and senescence, I would argue, better than anybody in the lab. Because once you get an animal in the lab, it doesn’t live a natural life, even if it’s a mouse. Mice don’t naturally live in a tiny plastic tub, they live in a much more complex environment. It’s the same with wild birds. If you bring wild birds into the lab, they may be OK, but they don’t senesce the same way.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf we track and test the animals in the wild for their entire life, we may have a better chance to detect and study senescence. And we can test two closely related species, like let’s say our chickadees and great tits, which do not cache food and so may not need specialized spatial memory. If we were to find that for great tits the cognition starts to decline at three years, and our birds maybe at seven\u003cem\u003e — whoa.\u003c/em\u003e Then we can ask some very interesting questions about how it is that these two species age so differently and how chickadees keep their memory for so much longer. It could maybe lead to a better understanding of things like Alzheimer’s. I probably wouldn’t be able to do that part myself, but somebody might.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e10.1146/knowable-090519-1\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://betsymason.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eBetsy Mason\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e is a freelance journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area who specializes in science and cartography.

Memories stored in engrams can be forgotten “passively” by different processes (lower left), such as loss of contextual cues permitting retrieval of the memory, interference with retrieval by other similar memories, or simply the decay of unstable biological materials in the engram cells. Some researchers believe “active” forgetting may be more potent at erasing memory than the passive mechanisms. Several forms of active forgetting have been proposed, including intentional attempts to suppress unpleasant memories (motivated forgetting); forgetting of some parts of a memory by retrieval of other parts; decay of memory induced by interference from other information processing; and “intrinsic” forgetting — erasure of information by cells and biochemical processes as an essential part of the brain’s memory apparatus for managing information efficiently.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\\n\u003c/figure\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome forgetting does appear to be “passive” — a result of either natural decay of the biological material forming engrams or the loss of ability to retrieve them, Davis and Zhong noted. But many forms of forgetting are more like running a program that wipes data off your hard drive. New stimuli can actively interfere with old memories, for instance. Recalling parts of a memory can induce loss of other parts of it. And “forgetting cells” might actually signal the brain to sweep memory traces away, Davis and Zhong suggested. “We posit that … the brain also has the inherent biological capacity to erode memory traces using signaling systems” similar to those used in acquiring memories and storing them. In fact, forgetting could be the brain’s main strategy in managing information.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“I would speculate that forgetting might be the default system of the brain,” Davis said at the neuroscience meeting. “We might have a slow chronic forgetting signal in our brains that basically says let’s erase everything unless a judge … comes to intervene and says this memory is worth saving.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn various experimental studies, Davis and others have amassed ample evidence for the role of biochemical processes that actively erase memory. Studies in fruit flies, for instance, implicate the well-known chemical messenger molecule dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFlies can remember to avoid an odor that has been accompanied by an electric shock, a memory managed by nerve cells known as mushroom body neurons. Shocks activate other neurons that transmit dopamine to the mushroom body cells, initiating biochemical reactions that store a memory linking the shock to the odor. But that memory is soon forgotten (typically by the next day). Something erases it, and the evidence suggests dopamine is responsible for the forgetting, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eDopamine’s dual role is not fully understood. But mushroom body neurons possess two distinct molecular antennas that respond to dopamine; one of those antennas (or receptor molecules) initiates memory formation, the other promotes erasure. Whether dopamine promotes or erases memory may depend on the context, including prevailing biochemical conditions and how active the mushroom body neuron is at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Graphic shows two ways that dopamine acts at a synapse between a nerve cell and mushroom body neuron to influence memory.

That memory forms because the shock stimulates the release of the molecule dopamine from nerve cells linked to mushroom body neurons at the same time that the odor triggers a cellular signal (via calcium). When stimulated by dopamine, a “molecular antenna” or receptor molecule (dDA1) on the mushroom body neuron initiates chemical reactions (via the cAMP signaling molecule) that restructure the mushroom body neuron, strengthening the memory. Recall fades over time as, in the absence of the odor, lower levels of dopamine stimulate another dopamine receptor molecule (DAMB), leading to a weakening of the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\\n\u003c/figure\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the erasing process involves a protein known as Rac1, which plays a part in structuring synapses. Restructuring synapses in response to Rac1 may be responsible for weakening engrams, some studies indicate. Blocking Rac1 activity, for example, helps to extend how long memories persist.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eRac1 may also be involved in a second forgetting mechanism, driven by the birth of new nerve cells (the process known as neurogenesis). Studies in rats have found that new neurons integrated into existing neural circuits can restructure the circuitry. Such changes in connections might make memories harder to access, Frankland said at the neuroscience meeting. Animal studies have shown that disrupting neurogenesis preserves memories, while high levels of neurogenesis drive forgetting. Whether that form of forgetting is important in humans remains unknown, as the amount of neurogenesis in adult humans is still an unsettled question.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the evidence suggests that many types of “forgetting cells” must be involved in erasing engrams. “Dozens of molecular and cellular pathways likely exist to erode memories,” Davis and Zhong wrote in \u003cem\u003eNeuron\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHow and when those processes operate can depend on various factors, such as physical activity, stress and sleep. Sleep is known to enhance memory in humans and other animals, presumably by providing a time when memories can be stored (or “consolidated”) in the brain. But sleep may also aid memory by suppressing the processes that drive forgetting, Davis and Zhong point out. A 2015 study \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.027\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003epublished in \u003cem\u003eCell\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e found evidence that sleep inhibits release of the dopamine forgetting signal to mushroom body neurons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf forgetting is the key to how the brain successfully processes the massive data input it encounters each day — as research accumulated so far suggests — then flaws in the forgetting process could plausibly contribute to brain disorders, Davis and Zhong note. Deficits in the ability to forget may be involved in autism spectrum disorders, for instance. Certainly the powerful and debilitating memories of post-traumatic stress disorder reflect an inability to forget disturbing experiences. Unwanted, repetitive invasive memories are a feature of some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. And the inability to forget cues associated with addictive drug use impairs recovery from substance abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the plus side, better insight into the biology of forgetting could help identify drugs capable of enhancing needed memories while disposing of undesirable ones.

In fact, forgetting could be the brain’s main strategy in managing information.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“I would speculate that forgetting might be the default system of the brain,” Davis said at the neuroscience meeting. “We might have a slow chronic forgetting signal in our brains that basically says let’s erase everything unless a judge … comes to intervene and says this memory is worth saving.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn various experimental studies, Davis and others have amassed ample evidence for the role of biochemical processes that actively erase memory. Studies in fruit flies, for instance, implicate the well-known chemical messenger molecule dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFlies can remember to avoid an odor that has been accompanied by an electric shock, a memory managed by nerve cells known as mushroom body neurons. Shocks activate other neurons that transmit dopamine to the mushroom body cells, initiating biochemical reactions that store a memory linking the shock to the odor. But that memory is soon forgotten (typically by the next day). Something erases it, and the evidence suggests dopamine is responsible for the forgetting, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eDopamine’s dual role is not fully understood. But mushroom body neurons possess two distinct molecular antennas that respond to dopamine; one of those antennas (or receptor molecules) initiates memory formation, the other promotes erasure. Whether dopamine promotes or erases memory may depend on the context, including prevailing biochemical conditions and how active the mushroom body neuron is at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the erasing process involves a protein known as Rac1, which plays a part in structuring synapses. Restructuring synapses in response to Rac1 may be responsible for weakening engrams, some studies indicate. Blocking Rac1 activity, for example, helps to extend how long memories persist.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eRac1 may also be involved in a second forgetting mechanism, driven by the birth of new nerve cells (the process known as neurogenesis). Studies in rats have found that new neurons integrated into existing neural circuits can restructure the circuitry. Such changes in connections might make memories harder to access, Frankland said at the neuroscience meeting. Animal studies have shown that disrupting neurogenesis preserves memories, while high levels of neurogenesis drive forgetting. Whether that form of forgetting is important in humans remains unknown, as the amount of neurogenesis in adult humans is still an unsettled question.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the evidence suggests that many types of “forgetting cells” must be involved in erasing engrams. “Dozens of molecular and cellular pathways likely exist to erode memories,” Davis and Zhong wrote in \u003cem\u003eNeuron\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHow and when those processes operate can depend on various factors, such as physical activity, stress and sleep. Sleep is known to enhance memory in humans and other animals, presumably by providing a time when memories can be stored (or “consolidated”) in the brain. But sleep may also aid memory by suppressing the processes that drive forgetting, Davis and Zhong point out. A 2015 study \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.027\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003epublished in \u003cem\u003eCell\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e found evidence that sleep inhibits release of the dopamine forgetting signal to mushroom body neurons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf forgetting is the key to how the brain successfully processes the massive data input it encounters each day — as research accumulated so far suggests — then flaws in the forgetting process could plausibly contribute to brain disorders, Davis and Zhong note. Deficits in the ability to forget may be involved in autism spectrum disorders, for instance. Certainly the powerful and debilitating memories of post-traumatic stress disorder reflect an inability to forget disturbing experiences. Unwanted, repetitive invasive memories are a feature of some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. And the inability to forget cues associated with addictive drug use impairs recovery from substance abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the plus side, better insight into the biology of forgetting could help identify drugs capable of enhancing needed memories while disposing of undesirable ones. But such benefits may appear only after much more research, Davis said at the neuroscience meeting — speaking at a rather sparsely attended session.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re at the very, very beginning of trying to understand the neurobiology of active forgetting,” he said. But he expects that the field will rapidly attract more attention.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“I guarantee you five years from now this room will be filled,” he said. “Hordes of neuroscientists will start invading this field.” If he’s right, future meetings on forgetting might best be convened at a spacious palace — with plenty of trash bins and perhaps even a dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-011019-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom Siegfried\u003c/b\u003e is a science writer and editor in the Washington, DC, area.

The giant planet is a bully, whose gravity can reach far and wide to push around smaller worlds and assorted debris. In the most successful simulations of the time, Jupiter and one of the two outermost planets ricocheted off each other and eventually settled into their modern orbits. But that only occurred about one percent of the time. In the other 99 percent of cases, Jupiter flung Uranus or Neptune so hard that they left the solar system, never to return.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“That makes things weird, because we know Uranus and Neptune survived,” Nesvorný says.

If the Kuiper belt were a donut, Batygin says, the cold classical belt would be the chocolate filling — a family of objects whose orbits lie nearly flat within the Kuiper belt. A passing planet should have stirred up those orbits, or so Batygin and colleagues thought.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTheir computer simulations showed that it did no such thing.

Its origin is a bit of a mystery. In 2015, Nesvorný argued that \u003ca href=\\\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/150/3/68/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea jump in Neptune’s outward migration\u003c/a\u003e — caused by an ejected planet — could be responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs Neptune trekked to its final orbit and swept up debris into orbits synced to its own, a “bump” at the right time could have released some of that debris, leaving it to become an independent stream, like the kernel. Simulations showed that the gravitational kick that made Jupiter jump and tossed out the extra planet would have happened at the right time to whack Neptune as well.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“You end up with something like the kernel,” Nesvorný says. “It’s circumstantial evidence … but it’s not conclusive.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is, we may never know exactly what went down in the solar system’s formative years. “We can’t write a solar system bible,” Batygin says. “We can only give a very murky story.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf the solar system did kick out one of its own, it’s in good company. In recent years, astronomers have found a handful of rogue planets adrift between the stars, most likely ejected from their homes. With some extrapolation, “these observations show that there are more free-floating, Jupiter-sized planets in the galaxy than there are stars,” Nesvorný says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat might be an overstatement — recent estimates \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23276\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eput the number at closer to one rogue Jupiter for every four stars\u003c/a\u003e — but that’s still billions of wandering worlds.

Using complex computer simulations, researchers had assembled a narrative in which the infant planets formed relatively close together and then jockeyed for position, alternately gliding and leaping from one orbit to another. Those simulations explained many of the minute details about how the planets, asteroids and comets orbit the sun today.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eExcept there was one problem.

But a fifth giant planet, many researchers suspect, could be the hero that this mystery needs, and a critical missing player in the history of the solar system.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eA phantom planet\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTo re-create these ancient scenes, astronomers rely on computer simulations to generate thousands of different solar systems in thousands of different ways. In lines of code, they lay out the laws of physics and the starting lineup of any planetary arrangement they can imagine. The researcher sets the stage — drop a planet here, sprinkle some asteroids there — then steps back and lets simulated nature take its course. After a couple of weeks in the real world — in which millions of years play out in the simulation — the astronomer peeks inside to see how the solar system turned out. The closer it is to the real thing, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what Nesvorný was doing in 2009. He was playing around with virtual solar systems, trying to figure out a way to save virtual Uranus and virtual Neptune from a one-way trip into virtual deep space.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was Jupiter. The giant planet is a bully, whose gravity can reach far and wide to push around smaller worlds and assorted debris. In the most successful simulations of the time, Jupiter and one of the two outermost planets ricocheted off each other and eventually settled into their modern orbits. But that only occurred about one percent of the time. In the other 99 percent of cases, Jupiter flung Uranus or Neptune so hard that they left the solar system, never to return.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“That makes things weird, because we know Uranus and Neptune survived,” Nesvorný says. So he kept tinkering. After a year of trying countless different scenarios, he started playing with the idea of adding martyr worlds: extra planets sacrificed to save the others.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“I would run these simulations just to see what would happen, not taking them too seriously,” Nesvorný says. “But then I realized there might be some truth in them.” He ran roughly 10,000 simulations, changing the number of extra planets, their starting locations and their masses in each one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe best scenario — the one that reproduced a solar system that most closely resembles the real one — was one with \u003ca href=\\\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ean extra planet that lived between the original orbits of Saturn and Uranus\u003c/a\u003e. The world was roughly as massive as Uranus and Neptune, or about 16 times as massive as Earth. It was this planet that could have gotten tangled with Jupiter’s orbit and been tossed out of the solar system.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe odds still aren’t great. Repeated simulations of this setup worked only about five percent of the time. “The present solar system is neither a typical nor expected result,” Nesvorný wrote in a 2012 paper exploring the idea, cowritten by his colleague Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatory of the Côte d’Azur in France. But it was a significant improvement over the one-percent success rate of simulations that included only the four giant planets we know and love today.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Invoking the existence of a fifth [giant] planet is actually much simpler than not,” says Sean Raymond, a planetary scientist at the University of Bordeaux in France. While the evidence is largely circumstantial, “it makes a lot more sense to have had an extra one back then.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat may seem like a stretch. How can astronomers know anything about what happened more than 4 billion years ago with the planets that we do have, much less ones that aren’t even here? Turns out, the planets left behind plenty of battle scars from their youth for planetary detectives to try to interpret.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eInterplanetary blood splatters\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“We are very certain that the planets didn’t form where they are today,” says Nathan Kaib, a planetary scientist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis realization was quite recent, though. For most of history, stargazers assumed that the planets had always followed their existing orbits. But in the early 1990s, researchers realized that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/365819a0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esomething was amiss\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/365819a0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e in this scenario\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eJust past the orbit of Neptune lies the Kuiper belt, a splash of icy debris encircling the sun. “They are the blood splatters on the wall,” says California Institute of Technology planetary scientist Konstantin Batygin.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrangement of the Kuiper belt objects led researchers to an inescapable conclusion: Neptune had to have formed closer to the sun than it is today. Many of the objects in the Kuiper belt clump together in concentric orbits, vaguely resembling the grooves in a record. And these aren’t just random orbits — they are linked directly to Neptune’s.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTake Pluto, the Kuiper belt’s most famous resident. It and a couple hundred of its known companions go around the sun exactly twice for every three trips that Neptune makes. Other streams of Kuiper objects go around once for every two of Neptune’s revolutions, or four for every seven.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no way for the Kuiper belt to end up that way on its own. If, however, Neptune formed closer to the sun and then moseyed outward, its gravity would have acted like a net, trapping nearby interplanetary debris in these special orbits and bringing it along for the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis matched what some simulations \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103584901015?via%3Dihub\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehinted at the\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103584901015?via%3Dihub\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e decade before\u003c/a\u003e. Planet formation was a messy business that left debris scattered all over the solar system. Any fragments that came too close to Neptune would have been steered by the planet’s gravity. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, each time Neptune nudged a fragment, the planet would have been pushed in the opposite direction. Over time Neptune would have crawled slowly away from the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eNeptune’s migration implicates the other giant planets as well. After all, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus were plowing through the same field of debris and dealing with similar gravitational interactions. If Neptune moved, then all the giant planets had to have moved.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it couldn’t have been a smooth ride.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe incessant grind from all this debris should have sculpted the orbits of the giant planets into perfect, aligned circles, much the way clay on a potter’s wheel is smoothed out by the potter’s steady hand. That’s not how the orbits ended up, though. The giant planets instead travel on orbits that are slightly elongated and askew. It’s as if someone bumped into the wheel, deforming the once-round pots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eJumping Jupiter\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBy 2005, researchers had uncovered a culprit. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03539\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eNew simulations\u003c/a\u003e indicated that at some point the giant planets must have undergone what scientists call a “dynamical instability.” In other words, things got crazy for about a million years.

An extra ice giant takes the brunt of Jupiter’s bullying while letting the other events in the narrative unfold unimpeded.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s completely plausible,” says Batygin. “[If you] ask is there any reason why we should have two instead of three ice giants, the answer is absolutely not.” In fact, he says, some calculations indicate that \u003ca href=\\\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/423612/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eas many as five Neptune-like worlds could have formed initially\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBatygin and colleagues were exploring this question at the same time as Nesvorný, though their motives were different. “I wanted to demonstrate that there could \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e have been an extra giant planet,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHe reasoned that this supposed planet, on its way out of the solar system, would have messed up a part of the Kuiper belt known as the cold classical belt. If the Kuiper belt were a donut, Batygin says, the cold classical belt would be the chocolate filling — a family of objects whose orbits lie nearly flat within the Kuiper belt. A passing planet should have stirred up those orbits, or so Batygin and colleagues thought.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTheir computer simulations showed that it did no such thing.

It doesn’t prove the planet existed, just that the solar system works whether it was there or not. Could this planet have left a more direct signature? Or back to the crime scene analogy, are there any skid marks? Nesvorný thinks there might be.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eA kernel of a clue\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere is another part of the Kuiper belt called the kernel, a narrow stream of icy fragments whose orbits are not currently synced to Neptune’s. Its origin is a bit of a mystery. In 2015, Nesvorný argued that \u003ca href=\\\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/150/3/68/meta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea jump in Neptune’s outward migration\u003c/a\u003e — caused by an ejected planet — could be responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs Neptune trekked to its final orbit and swept up debris into orbits synced to its own, a “bump” at the right time could have released some of that debris, leaving it to become an independent stream, like the kernel. Simulations showed that the gravitational kick that made Jupiter jump and tossed out the extra planet would have happened at the right time to whack Neptune as well.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“You end up with something like the kernel,” Nesvorný says. “It’s circumstantial evidence … but it’s not conclusive.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is, we may never know exactly what went down in the solar system’s formative years. “We can’t write a solar system bible,” Batygin says. “We can only give a very murky story.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf the solar system did kick out one of its own, it’s in good company. In recent years, astronomers have found a handful of rogue planets adrift between the stars, most likely ejected from their homes. With some extrapolation, “these observations show that there are more free-floating, Jupiter-sized planets in the galaxy than there are stars,” Nesvorný says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat might be an overstatement — recent estimates \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23276\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eput the number at closer to one rogue Jupiter for every four stars\u003c/a\u003e — but that’s still billions of wandering worlds. And those are just the ones as large as Jupiter. Our rogue was likely smaller, about the size of Neptune, and we have no idea how many of those are roaming the galaxy. But we do know that the universe tends to favor small things over large things.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet there will be many,” Nesvorný says.

Models suggest that the disk would have cleared itself out in about 1 million to 10 million years as its gas evaporated and its dust spiraled into the gravitational pull of the newborn sun. The biggest planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, somehow packed together a core of about 10 Earth masses before the disk vanished. Making planets from planetesimals would have simply taken too long, since planetesimals typically whiz past a baby planet without being captured by its gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n        \u003cimg width=\\\"\\\" height=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/content/2018-04/G_PebbleVsProtoV4-01%20%282%29.svg\\\" alt=\\\"Pebble capture\\\" title=\\\"Pebble capture\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n          \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditor’s note: The “A pull on pebbles” graphic was updated on April 24.

He calls the protoplanetary disks “pebble factories.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2010, Johansen and Lambrechts began to wonder how all these pebbles might relate to planets being born. They began a series of calculations on how pebbles might interact with other large rubbly fragments floating in the protoplanetary disk. To their surprise, Johansen and Lambrechts found that pebbles could quickly glom onto a protoplanet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe key is friction. Imagine a stream of pebbles whizzing by a 100-kilometer-wide protoplanet. As pebbles plow through gas within the disk, friction slows them down enough to be captured by the protoplanet’s gravitational field. The pebbles begin looping around the larger rock and soon smash onto its surface.

Studded within the orbiting disk were planetesimals, rocky objects roughly 1 to 100 kilometers across, and bigger protoplanets some 1,000 kilometers wide. It was as if a bunch of children of different sizes were corralled into the same room.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLike any nursery, it was a rowdy place. Planetesimals whizzed past, and occasionally smashed into, one another. Fragments of dust and rock raced through the disaster zone. It took a few million years for the preschool chaos to settle down and the bulk of today’s planets to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eScientists used to think that planets formed as planetesimals collided and merged, like fistfuls of Play-Doh slapped together. But it turns out that that process would have taken too long. So astronomers recently proposed a new way to explain how baby planets grew.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eComputer simulations show that small pebbles within the dusty disk would have glommed onto the growing protoplanets. Those tiny pebbles coalesced so rapidly that the protoplanets grew quickly into full-fledged planets — like a kid suddenly packing on enough pounds to become an adult.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis theory, known as pebble accretion, is reshaping how scientists think about the early solar system. It also opens new research directions, such as exploring how planets form around stars other than the sun. “You can form these bodies easily and quickly,” says Michiel Lambrechts, an astronomer at Lund University in Sweden and coauthor of the theory. “Pebble accretion provides a solution to so many problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eChief among those problems is how planets could form before the dusty disk ran out of the raw ingredients needed to make them. Models suggest that the disk would have cleared itself out in about 1 million to 10 million years as its gas evaporated and its dust spiraled into the gravitational pull of the newborn sun. The biggest planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, somehow packed together a core of about 10 Earth masses before the disk vanished. Making planets from planetesimals would have simply taken too long, since planetesimals typically whiz past a baby planet without being captured by its gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Pebble capture\\\" src=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/sites/default/files/articles/content/2018-04/G_PebbleVsProtoV4-01%20%282%29.svg\\\" title=\\\"Pebble capture\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditor’s note: The “A pull on pebbles” graphic was updated on April 24.

Astronomers know that such pebbles exist, because they have seen them orbiting infant stars.

He calls the protoplanetary disks “pebble factories.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2010, Johansen and Lambrechts began to wonder how all these pebbles might relate to planets being born. They began a series of calculations on how pebbles might interact with other large rubbly fragments floating in the protoplanetary disk. To their surprise, Johansen and Lambrechts found that pebbles could quickly glom onto a protoplanet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe key is friction. Imagine a stream of pebbles whizzing by a 100-kilometer-wide protoplanet. As pebbles plow through gas within the disk, friction slows them down enough to be captured by the protoplanet’s gravitational field. The pebbles begin looping around the larger rock and soon smash onto its surface. Each collision adds a tiny bit of mass — and with enough such collisions, the protoplanet grows quickly, to 1,000 kilometers across or more. “In many ways, pebble accretion is the most efficient way of adding mass to a body,” says Lambrechts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf a protoplanetary disk included equal masses of rock, half in planetesimals and half in pebbles, the pebbles would accrete 1,000 times more effectively than the planetesimals, says Lambrechts.

But for us to see it, to find life on other worlds where we can’t fly and drill through the ice, we really have to see that the atmosphere gets changed due to life. And therefore we have defined this habitable zone as where water could be liquid, if it exists.

But the other thing that is maybe more important to our survival is that when we find other Earths, we’ll find some that are older, we’ll find some that are younger.

I think one of the things that we’ll always do is we’ll keep our eyes open for things that we can’t explain. However, the big problem is that even if you look at life on the Earth — for the first 2 billion years, it produced carbon dioxide and methane alone. And that’s not unique to life. This could also be just outgassing of some material [created by physical or chemical processes, not via biological activity]. This is why we would need an incredibly conservative thing to look for so that we really have no other explanation than life. [For example, one gas isn’t enough. Plants create oxygen, but so do water molecules when they’re split by ultraviolet light from the sun.] And this is why we came down to oxygen with methane or nitrous oxide, or ozone with methane.

JWST is going to be the first time that we can actually look at the atmospheres of such small planets because it has enough collecting area to give us enough light. It’s going to be hard, it’s going to be at the breaking point of technical possibility, but it’s doable.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do you see this field going in the next 20 to 30 years?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s going to be an extension of planetary science. It will actually encompass the whole picture. Planetary science does eight planets, and asteroids, and stuff in our solar system. But now with better telescopes, we’ll add that kind of information for many other alien suns and their planets to the mix. The data we’re getting right now is like the first data we got on Mars.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe other solar systems should yield more and more information to the point where we can actually put our planetary system in context. We won’t be able to travel there, but we’ll be able to catch more and more of the light and maybe figure out what’s on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is humankind’s next adventure. We’re not going to get off this planet anytime soon, and that’s fine, I love this planet.
